<p><b>Richard Webster</b> (17 December 1950 – 24 June 2011<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-1">[1]</a></sup>) was a British author. His five published books deal with subjects such as the <a href="/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses_controversy" title="The Satanic Verses controversy">controversy</a> over <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses" title="The Satanic Verses">The Satanic Verses</a></i> (1988), <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> and <a href="/wiki/Psychoanalysis" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a>, and the investigation of sexual abuse in Britain. Born in Newington, <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, Webster studied <a href="/wiki/English_literature" title="English literature">English literature</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_East_Anglia" title="University of East Anglia">University of East Anglia</a> and lived in <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, England. He became interested in the problem of false allegations partly due to reading the work of historian <a href="/wiki/Norman_Cohn" title="Norman Cohn">Norman Cohn</a>.
</p><p>In <i><a href="/wiki/A_Brief_History_of_Blasphemy" title="A Brief History of Blasphemy">A Brief History of Blasphemy</a></i> (1990), Webster tries to understand the Muslim response to <i>The Satanic Verses</i> and argues against unrestricted <a href="/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" title="Freedom of speech">freedom of speech</a>. The book was praised by <a href="/wiki/Rowan_Williams" title="Rowan Williams">Rowan Williams</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Canterbury" title="Archbishop of Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. Webster may be best remembered for his subsequent book <i><a href="/wiki/Why_Freud_Was_Wrong" title="Why Freud Was Wrong">Why Freud Was Wrong</a></i> (1995), in which he argues that Freud became a kind of Messiah and that psychoanalysis is a disguised continuation of the <a href="/wiki/Judeo-Christian" title="Judeo-Christian">Judaeo-Christian</a> tradition. The book was praised by several commentators. In <i>The Secret of Bryn Estyn: The Making of a Modern Witch Hunt</i> (2005), Webster tells the story of a care home for adolescent boys that became the focus of press revelations and a police investigation for child abuse that spread across a number of residential homes in North Wales.

<p>Webster, the son of a subpostmaster, was born in 1950, in Newington, <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, and raised in a strict <a href="/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> family; according to journalist <a href="/wiki/Bob_Woffinden" title="Bob Woffinden">Bob Woffinden</a>, "His parents' work ethic meant he had much time to himself, leading to independence of thought and intellectual rebellion." He attended <a href="/wiki/Sir_Roger_Manwood%27s_School" title="Sir Roger Manwood's School">Sir Roger Manwood's School</a> in Sandwich, Kent and graduated in English and American studies from the University of East Anglia. Webster returned to the University to teach in 1974 and 1975 and started a PhD, which he did not complete. When his father became ill, Webster ran the family post office, which had been shifted to Cambridge.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Having married in 1977,<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-1">[1]</a></sup> Webster started The Orwell Bookshop in Southwold with his wife Bod in 1985.<sup id="cite_ref-Blasphemy_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blasphemy-2">[2]</a></sup> The shop was successful, but was sold because Webster's other interests demanded too much of his time. Webster moved to Oxford after the break-up of his marriage.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>In his <i>A Brief History of Blasphemy</i> (1990), Webster described himself as "an atheist who was brought up as a Methodist."<sup id="cite_ref-Blasphemy_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blasphemy-2">[2]</a></sup> This work led Margareta Petersson to describe him as being one of the few Western writers who have "tried to view the Rushdie affair from a Muslim perspective", one who views <a href="/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses_controversy" title="The Satanic Verses controversy">the controversy over <i>The Satanic Verses</i></a> not as a single case of confrontation between <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a> and the West, but the most recent of a series of hostile encounters, which started as soon as <a href="/wiki/Muhammad" title="Muhammad">Muhammad</a>'s movement had grown strong.<sup id="cite_ref-Petersson_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Petersson-3">[3]</a></sup> Webster once wrote that: "...at the heart of almost everything I have written over the last twenty years or so is the view that, in our modern, proudly rationalist attempts to break the links which tie us to our superstitious, essentially religious past, we have become profoundly muddled about our own cultural history." He noted that his investigations into police 'trawling operations', which occupied him for a number of years, were not a diversion from his theory of cultural history but an attempt to apply it in practice.<sup id="cite_ref-Webster.27s_home_page_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Webster.27s_home_page-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Webster made the acquaintance of literary critic <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Crews" title="Frederick Crews">Frederick Crews</a> while the latter was working on the essays that appeared in his <i><a href="/wiki/The_Memory_Wars" title="The Memory Wars">The Memory Wars</a></i> (1995); Crews thanked Webster for his help, and commented that his contact with him had been enriching.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> Webster's <i>Why Freud Was Wrong</i> (1995) received acclaim, as well as some criticism.<sup id="cite_ref-Masson_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Masson-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>With Bob Woffinden, Webster helped find lawyers for Dawn Reed and Christopher Lillie, former <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle</a> nurses who were falsely accused of sexually abusing children in their care. Reed and Lillie, who were first accused of child abuse in 1993 and only found not guilty in 2002, say that they would probably be dead, through suicide or murder, without this assistance. Reed told <i><a href="/wiki/The_Observer" title="The Observer">The Observer</a></i> that, "After all that had happened, to find people who wanted to help us just out of the goodness of their hearts was amazing".<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Webster explained his interest in the problem of false allegations in his <i>The Secret of Bryn Estyn</i> (2005):
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">... when I was an undergraduate reading English literature at the University of East Anglia, I stumbled upon a book by the historian <a href="/wiki/Norman_Cohn" title="Norman Cohn">Norman Cohn</a>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Pursuit_of_the_Millennium" title="The Pursuit of the Millennium">The Pursuit of the Millennium</a></i>&#160;... The extraordinary range and power of Cohn's book lead me to read his other work&#160;– his book about conspiracy theories and modern anti-semitism, <i>Warrant for Genocide</i>, and, when it appeared in 1975, <i>Europe's Inner Demons</i>, his study of the great European witch-hunt of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. All three books seek to establish the role played in history by collective fantasies and all three are concerned with "the urge to purify the world through the annihilation of some category of human beings imagined as agents of corruption and incarnations of evil."&#160;... The Paladin paperback edition of <i>Europe's Inner Demons</i>, which appeared in 1976, bore on its cover these words of Anthony Storr: "This is a book of real stature which I hope will have wide impact. Only if we begin to understand the horrifying recesses of the human imagination can we prevent the recurrence of those dreadful, irrational persecutions which have so disfigured human history." Without my fully realising it at the time, those words influenced me deeply and I have since taken it for granted that the principal reason why we should study the witch-hunts of the past is to enable us the better to recognise and oppose the witch-hunts of the present and the future.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

<p>In 2005, <a href="/wiki/Wrexham_County_Borough_Council" title="Wrexham County Borough Council">Wrexham council</a> decided, following legal advice, to refuse permission for <a href="/wiki/Falsely_Accused_Carers_and_Teachers" title="Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers">Falsely Accused Carers and Teachers</a> (FACT) North Wales, a support group for carers and teachers, to hold its conference 'False Allegations&#160;– Truthful Answers' at the Erlas Centre, one of its venues, after it learned the purpose of the event. Webster, who was to have been a key speaker at the conference, had been going to discuss <i>The Secret of Bryn Estyn</i>. Wrexham councillor Malcolm King was quoted saying that he was "very pleased" that the council had prevented something that "would have been very hurtful to many people who have already been hurt enough". Webster stated in reply that he was "flabbergasted" by the council's action, and that Mr King "entirely missed the point", since the evidence showed that there never was a <a href="/wiki/Pedophilia" title="Pedophilia">paedophile</a> ring based at Bryn Estyn and that dozens of staff had been wrongly accused.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>Webster died of natural causes in 2011; he had undergone heart surgery a decade before his death. Julie Summers, who knew Webster through the Writers in Oxford group, said of him: "What was so special about him was he had this very gentle, but very, very clear view on things. You could always rely on him to cut through the mud and see exactly the point of an issue. He had a very clear mind."<sup id="cite_ref-Oxford_Mail_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Oxford_Mail-10">[10]</a></sup> Webster had spent much of the year assisting Portuguese contacts to expose the <a href="/wiki/Casa_Pia_child_sexual_abuse_scandal" title="Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal">Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal</a> as a scare, and had been due to publish a history of the affair, <i>Casa Pia</i>. Webster also left behind an unfinished book, <i>The Natural History of Human Beings</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>In <i>The Great Children's Home Panic</i> (1998), Webster discusses police investigation of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_abuse" title="Sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> in Britain. <a href="/wiki/Christian_Wolmar" title="Christian Wolmar">Christian Wolmar</a> writes that in Webster's view "there is a grave risk of <a href="/wiki/Injustice" title="Injustice">injustice</a> against care workers because there are financial incentives" to make false claims and police have encouraged alleged victims to come forward by suggesting that they may obtain damages. Wolmar states that while the police initially referred people to lawyers, they are now reluctant to do this, as it has enabled defence lawyers to undermine the credibility of witnesses, and that many of those who make successful claims through the <a href="/wiki/Criminal_Injuries_Compensation_Authority" title="Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority">Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority</a> (CICA) lose much of the award. According to him, while Webster sees claims to CICA as vulnerable to abuse because of its low standards of proof, lawyers acting on behalf of victims observe that even making claims to CICA is painful. He cites solicitor Bilhar Singh Uppal as arguing that while Webster is right to open debate, there has been no wholesale fabrication of evidence.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Damian_Thompson" title="Damian Thompson">Damian Thompson</a> writes that in Webster's view "investigations into child abuse in care homes in the early 1990s were disfigured by the zealotry associated with the <a href="/wiki/Satanic_ritual_abuse" title="Satanic ritual abuse">Ritual Satanic Abuse</a> affair".<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Chris_Beckett" title="Chris Beckett">Chris Beckett</a> writes that while Webster accepts that abuse occurs, he considers many convictions against former residential workerers miscarriages of justice and sees them as similar to witch-hunts. Beckett sees Webster's case against the widespread belief that the residential care system was infiltrated by <a href="/wiki/Pedophilia" title="Pedophilia">paedophile</a> rings as well-argued. According to Beckett, Webster argues that police procedures in North Wales dangerously reverse normal police methods, by starting with suspects and then interviewing large numbers of people to find out whether a crime was committed; this process is flawed since former residents of residential homes may have motives to make false accusations.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
