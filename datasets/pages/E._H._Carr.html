<p><b>Edward Hallett </b>"<b>Ted</b>"<b> Carr</b> <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a> (28 June 1892 – 3 November 1982) was an English historian, diplomat, journalist and <a href="/wiki/International_relations" title="International relations">international relations</a> theorist, and an opponent of <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a> within <a href="/wiki/Historiography" title="Historiography">historiography</a>.
</p><p>Carr was best known for his 14-volume history of the Soviet Union, in which he provided an account of Soviet history from 1917 to 1929, for his writings on international relations, particularly <i><a href="/wiki/The_Twenty_Years%27_Crisis" title="The Twenty Years' Crisis">The Twenty Years' Crisis</a></i>, and for his book <i><a href="/wiki/What_Is_History%3F" title="What Is History?">What Is History?</a></i>, in which he laid out historiographical principles rejecting traditional historical methods and practices.
</p><p>Educated at the <a href="/wiki/Merchant_Taylors%27_School,_Northwood" title="Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood">Merchant Taylors' School</a>, London, and at <a href="/wiki/Trinity_College,_Cambridge" title="Trinity College, Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, Carr began his career as a diplomat in 1916; three years later, he participated at the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference</a> as a member of the British delegation.  Becoming increasingly preoccupied with the study of international relations and of the Soviet Union, he resigned from the Foreign Office in 1936 to begin an academic career. From 1941 to 1946, Carr worked as an assistant editor at <i>The Times</i>, where he was noted for his leaders (editorials) urging a socialist system and an Anglo-Soviet alliance as the basis of a post-war order. Afterwards, Carr worked on a massive 14-volume work on Soviet history entitled <i><a href="/wiki/A_History_of_Soviet_Russia" title="A History of Soviet Russia">A History of Soviet Russia</a></i>, a project that he was still engaged on at the time of his death in 1982. In 1961, he delivered the G. M. Trevelyan lectures at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> that became the basis of his book, <i>What Is History?</i> Moving increasingly towards the left throughout his career, Carr saw his role as the theorist who would work out the basis of a new international order.

</p><p>In 1919, Carr was part of the British delegation at the <a href="/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference,_1919" title="Paris Peace Conference, 1919">Paris Peace Conference</a> and was involved in the drafting of parts of the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a> relating to the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._24_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._24-1">[1]</a></sup> During the conference, Carr was much offended at the Allied, especially French, treatment of the Germans, writing that the German delegation at the peace conference were "cheated over the "Fourteen Points", and subjected to every petty humiliation".<sup id="cite_ref-Davies_p._477_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies_p._477-7">[7]</a></sup> Beside working on the sections of the Versailles treaty relating to the League of Nations, Carr was also involved in working out the borders between Germany and the newly reborn state of Poland. Initially, Carr favoured Poland, urging in a memo in February 1919 that Britain recognize Poland at once, and that the German city of <a href="/wiki/Danzig" title="Danzig" class="mw-redirect">Danzig</a> (modern <a href="/wiki/Gda%C5%84sk" title="Gdańsk">Gdańsk</a>, Poland) be ceded to Poland.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> In March 1919, Carr fought against the idea of a <a href="/wiki/Little_Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Little Treaty of Versailles">Minorities Treaty</a> for Poland, arguing that the rights of ethnic and religious minorities in Poland would be best guaranteed by not involving the international community in Polish internal affairs.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> By the spring of 1919, Carr's relations with the Polish delegation had declined to a state of mutual hostility.<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._29_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._29-11">[11]</a></sup> 
</p>
Carr's tendency to favour the claims of the Germans at the expense of the Poles led the British historian <a href="/wiki/Adam_Zamoyski" title="Adam Zamoyski">Adam Zamoyski</a> to note that Carr "...held views of the most extraordinary racial arrogance on all of the nations of Eastern Europe".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Carr's biographer, Jonathan Haslam, wrote in a 2000 essay that Carr grew up in a where German culture was deeply appreciated, which in turn always coloured Carr's views towards Germany throughout his life.<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_pp._21-35_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_pp._21-35-13">[13]</a></sup> As a result, Carr supported the territorial claims of the <i>Reich</i> against Poland. In a letter written in 1954 to his friend, <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Deutscher" title="Isaac Deutscher">Isaac Deutscher</a>, Carr described his attitude to Poland at the time: "The picture of Poland that was universal in Eastern Europe right down to 1925 was of a strong and potentially predatory power".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._29_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._29-11">[11]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>After the peace conference, Carr was stationed at the British Embassy in Paris until 1921, and in 1920 was awarded a <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceB-2">[2]</a></sup> At first, Carr had great faith in the League, which he believed would prevent both another world war and ensure a better post-war world.<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam_p._36_4-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam_p._36-4">[4]</a></sup> In the 1920s, Carr was assigned to the branch of the British Foreign Office that dealt with the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a> before being sent to the British Embassy in <a href="/wiki/Riga" title="Riga">Riga</a>, Latvia, where he served as Second Secretary between 1925–29.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._24_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._24-1">[1]</a></sup> In 1925, Carr married Anne Ward Howe, by whom he had one son.<sup id="cite_ref-Cobb180_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cobb180-14">[14]</a></sup> During his time in Riga (which at that time possessed a substantial Russian émigré community), Carr became increasingly fascinated with Russian literature and culture and wrote several works on various aspects of Russian life.<sup id="cite_ref-Hughes-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._24_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Hughes-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._24-1">[1]</a></sup>

Carr learnt Russian during his time in Riga in order to read Russian writers in the original.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> In 1927, Carr paid his first visit to Moscow.<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceB_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceB-2">[2]</a></sup> Carr was later to write that reading <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Herzen" title="Alexander Herzen">Alexander Herzen</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoyevsky" title="Fyodor Dostoyevsky">Fyodor Dostoyevsky</a> and the work of other 19th-century Russian intellectuals caused him to re-think his liberal views.<sup id="cite_ref-Deutscher_pp._78_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Deutscher_pp._78-16">[16]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:80</sup> Carr wrote under the impact of reading various Russian writers he found his "liberal moralistic ideology" lacking and that "very intelligent people [...] looked at the world through very different eyes".

S. Mirsky">D. S. Mirsky</a>, a Russian émigré scholar living at that time in Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
Beside studies on <a href="/wiki/International_relations" title="International relations">international relations</a>, Carr's writings in the 1930s included biographies of Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1931), <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a> (1934), and <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> (1937). An early sign of Carr's increasing admiration of the Soviet Union was a 1929 review of Baron <a href="/wiki/Pyotr_Nikolayevich_Wrangel" title="Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel">Pyotr Wrangel</a>'s memoirs where Carr wrote: <blockquote>"It is not longer possible for any sane man to regard the campaigns of Kolchak, Yudenich, Denikin and Wrangel otherwise than as tragic blunders of colossal dimensions. They were monuments of folly in conception and of incompetence in execution; they cost, directly and indirectly, hundreds of thousands of lives; and except in so far as they may have increased the bitterness of the Soviet rulers against the "White" Russians and the Allies who half-heartedly supported them, they did not deflect the course of history by a single hair's breadth".<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup></blockquote> In an article entitled "Age of Reason" published in the <i>Spectator</i> on 26 April 1930, Carr attacked what he regarded as the prevailing culture of pessimism within the West, which he blamed on the French writer <a href="/wiki/Marcel_Proust" title="Marcel Proust">Marcel Proust</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._47_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._47-21">[21]</a></sup> Carr wrote:<blockquote>"It was about the turn of the [20th] century that the trouble began. It did not come from the rebels or radicals...It came rather with men like Kipling and Rostand, men loyal to the core to the old traditions, men of genius-and yet who somehow did not quite pull it off...The great days of the glory of man and his achievements were numbered. The vein was petering out; in some strange way it no longer came off. It was, men said, the end of the Victorian Age...It was once the vulgar ambition of mankind to make something out of nothing; Proust brought perfection to the more genteel pastime of resolving everything into nothingness".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._47_21-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._47-21">[21]</a></sup></blockquote>
In the early 1930s, Carr found the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> to be almost profoundly shocking as the First World War. In an article entitled "England Adrift" published in September 1930, Carr wrote: <blockquote>"The prevailing state of mind in England to-day is one of defeatism or...skepticism, of disbelief in herself. England has ceased to have ideas, or if, she has them, to believe in the possibility of their fulfillment. Alone among the Great Powers she has ceased to have a mission...The government of the day has so little faith in its capacity to tackle the major problems of our generation that it invites the other parties to assist with their advice (imagine Mr Gladstone invoking the assistance of Lord Beaconsfield!), and the principle opposition party, knowing full well there is no solution, declines the invitation and keeps its hands free to wash them of the consequences...We have no convictions beyond a vague sort of fatalism".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam_p._37_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam_p._37-22">[22]</a></sup></blockquote>
Further increasing Carr's interest in a replacement ideology for liberalism was his reaction to hearing the debates in January 1931 at the General Assembly of the League of Nations in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland, and especially the speeches on the merits of free trade between the Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vojislav Marinkovich and the British Foreign Secretary <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Henderson" title="Arthur Henderson">Arthur Henderson</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-d481_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-d481-6">[6]</a></sup> Carr wrote:<blockquote>"At Geneva I followed some of the debates about the economic crisis, which seemed to spell the bankruptcy of capitalism. In particular I was stuck by the fact that everyone professed to believe that tariff barriers were a major cause of aggravation of the crisis, but that practically every country was busy erecting them. I happened to hear a speech by some minor delegate (Yugoslav, I think) which for the first time in my experience put the issue clearly and urgently. Free trade was the doctrine of economically powerful states, which flourished without protection, but would be fatal to weak states. This came as a revelation to me (like the revelation at Cambridge of the relativism of historiography), and was doubly significant because of the part played by free trade in my intellectual upbringing. If free trade went, the whole liberal outlook went with it." <sup id="cite_ref-d481_6-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-d481-6">[6]</a></sup></blockquote>
It was at this time that Carr started to admire the Soviet Union. Carr wrote in a book review in February 1931: <blockquote>"They [the Soviets] have discovered a new religion of the Kilowatt and the Machine, which may well be the creed for which modern civilization is waiting.... This new religion is growing up on the fringes of a Europe which has lost faith in herself. Contemporary Europe is aimlessly drifting, refusing to face unpalatable facts, and looking for external remedies for her difficulties. The important question for Europe at the present time is... whether the steel production of the Soviet Union will overtake that of Great Britain and France... whether Europe can discover in herself a driving force, an intensity of faith comparable to that now being generated in Russia".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam_p._37_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam_p._37-22">[22]</a></sup></blockquote> In a 1932 book review of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lancelot_Lawton&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lancelot Lawton (page does not exist)">Lancelot Lawton</a>'s <i>Economic History of Soviet Russia</i>, Carr dismissed Lawton's claim that the Soviet economy was a failure, and praised the British Marxist economist <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Dobb" title="Maurice Dobb">Maurice Dobb</a>'s extremely favourable assessment of the Soviet economy.<sup id="cite_ref-Davies.2C_R.W_pp._91-108_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies.2C_R.W_pp._91-108-23">[23]</a></sup> Carr concluded that "as regards economic development, Professor Dobb is conclusive".<sup id="cite_ref-Davies.2C_R.W_pp._91-108_23-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies.2C_R.W_pp._91-108-23">[23]</a></sup>
Beside writing on Soviet affairs, Carr also commented on other international events. In an essay published in February 1933 in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, Carr blamed what he regarded as a putative Versailles treaty for the recent accession to power of <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a><sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._59_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._59-24">[24]</a></sup> Carr wrote that in the 1920s, German leaders like <a href="/wiki/Gustav_Stresemann" title="Gustav Stresemann">Gustav Stresemann</a> were unable to secure sufficient modifications of the Versailles treaty, owing to the intractable attitude of the Western powers, especially France, and now the West had reaped what it had sown in the form of the Nazi regime.<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._59_24-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._59-24">[24]</a></sup> However, despite some concerns about National Socialism, Carr ended his essay by writing that:<blockquote>"The crucial point about Hitlerism is that its disciples not only believe in themselves, but believe in Germany. For the first time since the war a party appeared outside the narrow circles of the extreme Right which was not afraid to proclaim its pride in being German. It will perhaps one day be recognized as the greatest service of Hitlerism that, in a way quite unprecedented in German politics, it cut across all social distinctions, embracing in its ranks working men, <i>bourgeoisie</i>, intelligentsia and aristocrats. "Germany Awake!" became a living national faith".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._59_24-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._59-24">[24]</a></sup></blockquote>
Initially, Carr's political outlook was anti-Marxist and liberal.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> In his 1934 biography of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>, Carr presented his subject as highly intelligent man and a gifted writer, but one whose talents were devoted entirely for destruction.<sup id="cite_ref-L113_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-L113-26">[26]</a></sup> Carr argued that Marx's sole and only motivation was a mindless class hatred.<sup id="cite_ref-L113_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-L113-26">[26]</a></sup> Carr labelled <a href="/wiki/Dialectical_materialism" title="Dialectical materialism">dialectical materialism</a> gibberish, and the labour theory of value doctrinal and derivative.<sup id="cite_ref-L113_26-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-L113-26">[26]</a></sup> Carr wrote that:<blockquote>"The pseudo-Marxist is a pathetic figure.

Carr wrote that:<blockquote>
"In a sense, Marx is the protagonist and forerunner of the whole twentieth century revolution of thought. The nineteenth century saw the end of the period of humanism which began with the Renaissance-the period which took as its ideal the highest development of the faculties and liberties of the individual...Marx understood that, in the new order, the individual would play a minor part. Individualism implies differentiation; everything that is undifferentiated does not count. The Industrial Revolution would place in power the undifferentiated mass. Not man, but mass-man, not the individual, but the class, not the political man, would be the unit of the coming dispensation. Not only industry, but the whole of civilization, would become a matter of mass-production."<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>In view of his later conversion to a sort of quasi-Marxism, Carr was to find the passages in <i>Karl Marx: A Study in Fanaticism</i> criticizing Marx to be highly embarrassing, and refused to allow the book to be republished.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> Carr was to later call his Marx biography his worst book, and complained that he had written it only because his publisher had made a Marx biography the precondition of publishing the biography of <a href="/wiki/Mikhail_Bakunin" title="Mikhail Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> that he was writing.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> In his books such as <i>The Romantic Exiles</i> and <i>Dostoevsky</i>, Carr was noted for his highly ironical treatment of his subjects, implying that their lives were of interest but not of great importance.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> In the mid-1930s, Carr was especially preoccupied with the life and ideas of Bakunin.<sup id="cite_ref-Davies_p._479_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies_p._479-31">[31]</a></sup> During this period, Carr started writing a novel about the visit of a Bakunin-type Russian radical to Victorian Britain who proceeded to expose all of Carr regarded as the pretensions and hypocrisies of British bourgeois society.<sup id="cite_ref-Davies_p._479_31-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies_p._479-31">[31]</a></sup> The novel was never finished or published.<sup id="cite_ref-Davies_p._479_31-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies_p._479-31">[31]</a></sup>

As a diplomat in the 1930s, Carr took the view that great division of the world into rival trading blocs caused by the American <a href="/wiki/Smoot-Hawley_Tariff_Act" title="Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act" class="mw-redirect">Smoot Hawley Act</a> of 1930 was the principal cause of German belligerence in foreign policy, as Germany was now unable to export finished goods or import raw materials cheaply. In Carr's opinion, if Germany could be given its own economic zone to dominate in Eastern Europe comparable to the British Imperial preference economic zone, the U.S. dollar zone in the Americas, the French gold bloc zone and the Japanese economic zone, then the peace of the world could be assured. In a memo written on 30 January 1936, Carr wrote:<blockquote>"Since I think everyone is now agreed that it is dangerous to sit indefinitely on the safety-valve, and that Germany must expand somewhere, I feel that there is an overwhelming case for the view that the direction in which Germany can expand with a minimum of danger or inconvenience to British interests (whether political or economic) is in Central and South-Eastern Europe..."<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._59_24-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._59-24">[24]</a></sup></blockquote> Carr's views on appeasement caused much tension with his superior, the Permanent Undersecretary Sir <a href="/wiki/Robert_Vansittart,_1st_Baron_Vansittart" title="Robert Vansittart, 1st Baron Vansittart">Robert Vansittart</a>, and played a role in Carr's resignation from the Foreign Office later in 1936<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> In an article entitled "An English Nationalist Abroad" published in May 1936 in the <i>Spectator</i>, Carr wrote "The methods of the Tudor sovereigns, when they were making the English nation, invite many comparisons with those of the Nazi regime in Germany"<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._79_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._79-33">[33]</a></sup> In this way, Carr argued that it was hypocritical for people in Britain to criticize the Nazi regime's human rights record<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._79_33-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._79-33">[33]</a></sup> Because of Carr's strong antagonism to the <a href="/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles" title="Treaty of Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, which he viewed as unjust to Germany, Carr was very supportive of the Nazi regime's efforts to destroy Versailles through moves such as the <a href="/wiki/Remilitarisation_of_the_Rhineland" title="Remilitarisation of the Rhineland" class="mw-redirect">Remilitarisation of the Rhineland</a> in 1936<sup id="cite_ref-d483_34-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-d483-34">[34]</a></sup> Carr later wrote of his views in the 1930s that "No doubt, I was very blind".<sup id="cite_ref-d483_34-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-d483-34">[34]</a></sup>

Carr contended that the 19th century theory of a balance of interests amongst the powers was an erroneous belief and instead contended that international relations was an incessant struggle between the economically privileged "have" powers and the economically disadvantaged "have not" powers.<sup id="cite_ref-Laqueur.2C_Walter_p._114_43-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Laqueur.2C_Walter_p._114-43">[43]</a></sup> In this economic understanding of international relations, "have" powers like the United States, Britain and France were inclined to avoid war because of their contented status whereas "have not" powers like Germany, Italy and Japan were inclined towards war as they had nothing to lose.<sup id="cite_ref-j29_48-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-j29-48">[48]</a></sup> In Carr's opinion, ideological differences between fascism and democracy were beside the point as he used as an example Japan, which Carr argued was not a fascist state but still a "have not" power.<sup id="cite_ref-j29_48-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-j29-48">[48]</a></sup> Carr attacked <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> for claiming there was a "harmony of interests" between the individual and their community, writing that "the doctrine of the harmony of interests was tenable only if you left out of account the interests of the weak who must be driven to the wall".<sup id="cite_ref-Davies_pp._486_49-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies_pp._486-49">[49]</a></sup> Carr claimed after World War I, the American President <a href="/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> had unfortunately created an international order based on the doctrine of "harmony of interests" through the "utopian" instrument of the League of Nations with disastrous results.<sup id="cite_ref-Davies_pp._486_49-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Davies_pp._486-49">[49]</a></sup> Carr argued that the only way to make the League (which Carr otherwise held in complete contempt by 1939) an effective force for peace was to persuade Germany, Italy and Japan to return to the League by promising them that their economic grievances could and would be worked out at the League.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Carr called <i>The Twenty Year's Crisis</i>:<blockquote>"not exactly a Marxist work, but strongly impregnated with Marxist ways of thinking, applied to international affairs"<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup></blockquote> The distinction between "have" and "have not" nations perhaps reflected the influence of the theory first propagated by <a href="/wiki/Enrico_Corradini" title="Enrico Corradini">Enrico Corradini</a> and later adopted by <a href="/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> of the natural conflict between "proletarian" nations like Italy and "plutocratic" nations like Britain.

Deutscher's widow was later to write of the deep, if unlikely friendship that was stuck between:<blockquote>"...a self-educated, former member of the Polish Communist Party – Marxist by conviction, Jewish by origin – who was a refugee from Hitler and Stalin stranded in London; and, on the other side, an English historian who was an unmistakable product of Cambridge, a former member of the Foreign Office, schooled in a diplomatic service famous as a bastion of British traditionalism".<sup id="cite_ref-Deutscher_pp._78_16-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Deutscher_pp._78-16">[16]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:78–79</sup></blockquote>
In 1948, Carr condemned British acceptance of an American loan in 1946 as the marking the effective end of British independence.<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._152_102-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._152-102">[102]</a></sup> Carr wrote that:<blockquote>"The acceptance of the American loan with the conditions attached to it in 1946 was the turning point at which Britain ceased to control her own economic destinies. It is still arguable that the conditions should have been rejected and the consequences of rejection faced. The results of acceptance were perhaps psychological even more than practical. But the practical results should not be ignored. Through the conditions were never fully enforced, the fiasco of sterling convertibility in the summer of 1947 was extremely costly; and American objections to European economic union continued well into 1947-by which time the practical difficulties of its realization had enormously increased...The American loan opened the way to a silent infiltration of American influence into almost every walk of British public life. It is today almost impossible to imagine the appointment to any important public post (including posts in the Armed Forces and in the civil service as well as in industry) of anyone not <i>persona grata</i> in corresponding American circles. To be pro-American pays handsome dividends: to be known as anti-American is a bar to promotion to a responsible position in any walk of life. Worst of all, British dependence on the United States is now taken for granted in quite broad sections of the population and had [sic] bred a widespread sense of hopelessness and incapacity to help ourselves, so that American help and American patronage which were intended to provide a stimulus to increased productivity in Britain are in danger of producing the opposite result.".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._152_102-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._152-102">[102]</a></sup></blockquote> Carr went on to write that the best course for Britain was to seek neutrality in the Cold War and that "peace at any price must be the foundation of British policy".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._153_103-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._153-103">[103]</a></sup> Carr ended by writing:<blockquote>"It may be that the question whether war breaks out between Russia and America affects us far more than the question whether we can increase the productivity of labour or improve the organization of industry or the distribution of consumer goods. But the point is that we can hardly do anything about the first question and a great deal about the second".<sup id="cite_ref-Haslam.2C_p._153_103-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Haslam.2C_p._153-103">[103]</a></sup></blockquote> Carr took a great deal of hope from the <a href="/wiki/Tito%E2%80%93Stalin_Split" title="Tito–Stalin Split">Soviet–Yugoslav split</a> of 1948. In an essay entitled "Spectre of Communism" published in the <i>Times</i> on 2 July 1948, Carr wrote:<blockquote>"It is this identification of Communist ideology with Soviet power, pointed by the looser, but none the less patent, defence of western democratic ideas and capitalist practices with the power of the United States, which makes the present international conjuncture so dark and menacing...That the two strongest Powers in the world today have become the centres of groups of nations formed on the basis not of old-fashioned alliances of power politics, but of contending views on the way in which society should be organized, enhances the dangers of conflict in a way which no contemporary observer can ignore.

During his last years, Carr continued to maintain his optimism in a better future, in spite of what he regarded as grave setbacks.

One fraction headed by the Hungarian Communist <a href="/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun" title="Béla Kun">Béla Kun</a> preferred the policy of treating the non-communist left as "disguised fascists", whereas another fraction headed by the Bulgarian Communist <a href="/wiki/Georgi_Dimitrov" title="Georgi Dimitrov">Georgi Dimitrov</a> supported a policy of building popular fronts with socialists and liberals against fascism.<sup id="cite_ref-149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-149">[149]</a></sup> Carr argued that the adoption of the <a href="/wiki/Popular_Front" title="Popular Front" class="mw-redirect">Popular Front</a> policy in 1935 had been forced on Stalin by pressure from Communist parties abroad, especially the <a href="/wiki/French_Communist_Party" title="French Communist Party">French Communist Party</a><sup id="cite_ref-150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-150">[150]</a></sup> Carr contended that the 7th Congress of the Comintern in 1935 was essentially the end of the Comintern since it marked the abandonment of world revolution as a goal, and instead subordinated the cause of Communism and world revolution towards the goal of building popular fronts against fascism<sup id="cite_ref-151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-151">[151]</a></sup> Another related book that Carr was unable to complete before his death, and was published posthumously in 1984, was <i>The Comintern and the Spanish Civil War</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-152" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-152">[152]</a></sup>

When you read a work of history, always listen out for the buzzing. If you can detect none, either you are tone deaf or your historian is a dull dog. The facts are really not at all like fish on the fishmonger's slab. They are like fish swimming about in a vast and sometimes inaccessible ocean; and what the historian catches will depend partly on chance, but mainly on what part of the ocean he chooses to fish in and what tackle he chooses to use – these two factors being, of course, determined by the kind of fish he wants to catch. By and large, the historian will get the kind of facts he wants. History means interpretation. Indeed, if, standing Sir <a href="/wiki/George_Norman_Clark" title="George Norman Clark">George Clark</a> on his head, I were to call history "a hard core of interpretation surrounded by a pulp of disputable facts", my statement would, no doubt, be one-sided and misleading, but no more so, I venture to think, than the original <i>dictum</i>"<sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup></blockquote> For this reason, Carr argued that <a href="/wiki/Leopold_von_Ranke" title="Leopold von Ranke">Leopold von Ranke</a>'s famous dictum <i>wie es eigentlich gewesen</i> (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the "facts" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what "facts of the past" he or she intended to turn into "historical facts".<sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.<sup id="cite_ref-Huges-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._26_194-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huges-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._26-194">[194]</a></sup> In this way, Carr argued that history was "an unending dialogue between the past and present".<sup id="cite_ref-Huges-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._26_194-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Huges-Warrington.2C_Marnie_p._26-194">[194]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup>
<p>Carr used as an example of how he believed that "facts of the past" were transformed into the "facts of history" an obscure riot that took place in Wales in 1850 that saw a gingerbread seller

edited the selection in <i>Stresemanns Vermächtnis</i> to focus more on Stresemann's Nobel Peace Prize-winning successes and to make him seem more like an apostle of peace than what he really was (one of Stresemann's major interests was in partitioning Poland between Germany and the Soviet Union).<sup id="cite_ref-203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup> Moreover, Carr noted

diplomacy that were of primary interest to British readers, which had the effect of making it seem that Stesemann was almost exclusively concerned with relations with the Western powers and had little

argued that in the conversations between Stresemann and the Soviet Foreign Commissar <a href="/wiki/Georgy_Chicherin" title="Georgy Chicherin">Georgy Chicherin</a>, Stresemann does most of the talking and says all of the intelligent and original things, leading Carr to suggest that Stresemann himself had edited the papers to place himself in the best possible light.<sup

Likewise, Carr charged that historians are always influenced by the present when writing about the past.

Mommsen's <i>History of Rome</i> is similarly dismissed as a product and illustration of pre-Bismarckian Germany.

In his notes for a second edition of <i>What Is History?</i>, Carr remarked on recent trends in historiography. Carr wrote about the rise of social history that:<blockquote>"Since the First World War the impact of the materialist conception of history on historical writings has been very strong. Indeed, one might say that all serious historical work done in this period has been moulded by its influence. The symptom of this change has been the replacement, in general esteem, of battles, diplomatic manoeuvres, constitutional arguments and political intrigues as the main topics of history-'political history' in the broad sense-by the study of economic factors, of social conditions, of statistics of population, of the rise and fall of classes. The increasing popularity of sociology has been another feature of the same development; the attempt has sometimes been made to treat history as a branch of sociology."<sup id="cite_ref-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._171_248-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._171-248">[248]</a></sup></blockquote> About the rise of social history as a subject at the expense of political history, Carr wrote:<blockquote>"Social history is the bedrock. To study the bedrock alone is not enough; and becomes tedious; perhaps this is what happened to Annales. But you can't dispense with it".<sup id="cite_ref-249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-249">[249]</a></sup></blockquote> Through Carr himself had insisted that history was a social science, he regretted the decline of history as a discipline relative to the other social sciences, which he saw as a part of a conservative trend.<sup id="cite_ref-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._171_248-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._171-248">[248]</a></sup> Carr wrote:<blockquote>"History is preoccupied with fundamental processes of change.

This depends partly, no doubt, on his temperament, but largely on the environment in which he works. We live in a society which thinks of change chiefly as change for the worse, dreads it and prefers the "horizontal" view which calls only for minor adjustments".<sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup></blockquote> Repeating his attack on the empirical approach to history, Carr claimed that those historians who claimed to be strict empiricists like Captain <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Roskill" title="Stephen Roskill">Stephen Roskill</a> who took a just-the-facts approach would resemble a character named <a href="/wiki/Funes_the_Memorious" title="Funes the Memorious">Funes</a> in a short story by the Argentine writer <a href="/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges" title="Jorge Luis Borges">Jorge Luis Borges</a> who never forgot anything he had seen or heard, so his memory was a "garbage heap"<sup id="cite_ref-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._159_251-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._159-251">[251]</a></sup> Thus, Funes was "not very capable of thought" because "to think is forget differences, to generalise, to make abstractions"<sup id="cite_ref-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._159_251-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Carr.2C_E.H._1961.2C_p._159-251">[251]</a></sup> In his introduction to the second edition of <i>What Is History?</i> written shortly before his death in 1982, which was all that Carr had finished of the second edition, Carr proclaimed his belief that the western world was in a state of despair, writing:<blockquote>"The Cold War has resumed with redoubled intensity, bringing with it the threat of nuclear extinction. The delayed economic crisis has set in with a vengeance, ravaging the industrial countries and spreading the cancer of unemployment throughout the Western world [Carr is referring to <a href="/wiki/Early_1980s_recession" title="Early 1980s recession">the recession of the early 1980s</a> here.]. Scarcely a country is now free from the antagonism of violence and terrorism. The revolt of the oil-producing states of the Middle East has brought a significant shift in power to the disadvantage of the Western industrial nations [a reference on the part of Carr to the <a href="/wiki/1973_oil_crisis" title="1973 oil crisis">Arab oil shock of 1973–74</a> and to the <a href="/wiki/1979_energy_crisis" title="1979 energy crisis">Iranian oil shock of 1979</a>].

In these conditions any expression of optimism has come to seem absurd".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_252-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated1-252">[252]</a></sup></blockquote> Carr went on to declare his belief that the world was in fact getting better and wrote that it was only the West in decline, not the world, writing that:<blockquote>"My conclusion is that the current wave of scepticism and despair, which looks ahead to nothing but destruction and decay, and dismisses as absurd any belief in progress or any prospect of a further advance by the human race, is a form of elitism-the product of elite social groups whose security and whose privileges have been most conspicuously eroded by the crisis, and of elite countries whose once undisputed domination over the rest of the world has been shattered".<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated2_253-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-autogenerated2-253">[253]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>The claims that Carr made about the nature of historical work in <i>What Is History?</i> proved be very controversial, and inspired Sir <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Elton" title="Geoffrey Elton">Geoffrey Elton</a> to write his 1967 book <i>The Practice of History</i> in response, defending traditional historical methods.

Now this is something that we know not simply from the historical record. It is no mere interpretation derived from an examination of the documents of surrender signed aboard the USS <i>Missouri</i> in Tokyo Harbour in 1945. It is not an interpretation that future generations might overturn after they have scoured the nuances of the texts for so far undiscerned ideological meaning. The fact that the United States defeated Japan has shaped the very world that all of us have inhabited since 1945. The relations between states, the world economy, the employment market of every industrial country are all consequences in various ways of this historical truth. The world itself confirms the proposition.<br><br>Of course, E.H. Carr might argue the defeat of Japan is a mere 'fact' and the really interesting discussions are the interpretations historians make and the conclusions they draw from facts of this kind. Well, one man's fact can be another man's conclusion. For someone writing a narrative history of the war in the Pacific, the defeat of Japan is a very big conclusion indeed. There is no event that is inherently confined to the status of a mere fact, that is, a building block of a much larger conclusion.

<blockquote class="templatequote">In the first place, history is a sequence of cause and effect, whose course can be analysed and understood by intellectual effort, but not (as the utopians believe) directed by " imagination ". Secondly; theory does not (as the utopians assume) create practice, but practice theory. In Machiavelli's words, " good counsels, whence so ever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels ". Thirdly, politics are not (as the utopians pretend) a function of ethics, but ethics of politics. Men " are kept honest by constraint ". Machiavelli recognised the importance of morality, but thought that there could be no effective morality where there was no effective authority. Morality is the product of power.[Carr, 1939]
