<p><b>Oliver Wolf Sacks</b>, <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">CBE</a>, <a href="/wiki/Royal_College_of_Physicians" title="Royal College of Physicians">FRCP</a> (9 July 1933 – 30 August 2015) was a British <a href="/wiki/Neurology" title="Neurology">neurologist</a>, naturalist and author who spent his professional life in the United States. He believed that <a href="/wiki/Human_brain" title="Human brain">the brain</a> is the "most incredible thing in the universe" and therefore important to study.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He became widely known for writing best-selling case histories about his patients' disorders, with some of his books adapted for stage and film.<sup id="cite_ref-GuardianProfile_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GuardianProfile-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-CBE_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CBE-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>After Sacks received his medical degree from <a href="/wiki/The_Queen%27s_College,_Oxford" title="The Queen's College, Oxford">The Queen's College, Oxford</a> in 1960, he interned at <a href="/wiki/Middlesex_Hospital" title="Middlesex Hospital">Middlesex Hospital</a> (part of <a href="/wiki/University_College,_London" title="University College, London" class="mw-redirect">University College, London</a>) before moving to the U.S. He then interned at <a href="/wiki/UCSF_Medical_Center" title="UCSF Medical Center">Mount Zion Hospital</a> in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and neuropathology at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="University of California, Los Angeles">University of California, Los Angeles</a> (UCLA).<sup id="cite_ref-Cowles_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cowles-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> He relocated to New York in 1965, where he first worked under a paid fellowship in neurochemistry and neuropathology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The neuro-research career he envisioned for himself proved to be a poor fit, which he and his supervisors eventually realised. Beginning in September 1966 he began delivering direct patient care as a neurologist at a headache clinic in the Bronx.  In October 1966 Sacks began serving as neurologist at chronic-care facility Beth Abraham Hospital (now <a href="/wiki/Beth_Abraham_Health_Services" title="Beth Abraham Health Services" class="mw-redirect">Beth Abraham Health Services</a>, a member of CenterLight Health System) in <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">the Bronx</a>. At Beth Abraham, he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleepy sickness, <a href="/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica" title="Encephalitis lethargica">encephalitis lethargica</a>, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. These patients and his treatment of them were the basis of Sacks' book <i><a href="/wiki/Awakenings_(book)" title="Awakenings (book)">Awakenings</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-About_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-About-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>  Also in 1966 Sacks became a neurological consultant to various New York City nursing homes run by the <a href="/wiki/Little_Sisters_of_the_Poor" title="Little Sisters of the Poor">Little Sisters of the Poor</a>, and from 1966 to 1991 was a consulting neurologist at Bronx Psychiatric Center.
</p><p>Sacks was the author of numerous best-selling books, mostly collections of case studies of people with <a href="/wiki/Neurological_disorder" title="Neurological disorder">neurological disorders</a>. His writings have been featured in a wide range of media; the <i>New York Times</i> called him a "poet laureate of contemporary medicine", and "one of the great clinical writers of the twentieth century".<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  His books include a wealth of narrative detail about his experiences with patients, and how they coped with their conditions, often illuminating how the normal brain deals with perception, memory and individuality.
</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/Awakenings_(book)" title="Awakenings (book)">Awakenings</a></i> (1973), an autobiographical account of his efforts to help people with <a href="/wiki/Encephalitis_lethargica" title="Encephalitis lethargica">encephalitis lethargica</a> regain proper neurological function, was adapted into the <a href="/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award" class="mw-redirect">Academy Award</a>-nominated <a href="/wiki/Awakenings" title="Awakenings">film</a> in 1990, starring <a href="/wiki/Robin_Williams" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> and <a href="/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>.

</p><p>When Sacks was six years old, he and his brother Michael were evacuated from London to escape the <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" title="The Blitz">Blitz</a>, and sent to a boarding school in the <a href="/wiki/English_Midlands" title="English Midlands" class="mw-redirect">Midlands</a> where he remained until 1943.<sup id="cite_ref-GuardianProfile_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-GuardianProfile-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Unknown to his family, at the school, he and his brother Michael "... subsisted on meagre rations of turnips and beetroot and suffered cruel punishments at the hands of a sadistic headmaster".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> This is detailed in his first autobiography, <i><a href="/wiki/Uncle_Tungsten:_Memories_of_a_Chemical_Boyhood" title="Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood" class="mw-redirect">Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-uncle_tungsten_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-uncle_tungsten-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>  Later, he attended <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%27s_School_(London)" title="St Paul's School (London)" class="mw-redirect">St Paul's School</a> in London. During his youth he was a keen <a href="/wiki/Amateur_chemist" title="Amateur chemist" class="mw-redirect">amateur chemist</a>, as recalled in <i>Uncle Tungsten</i>.

</p><p>Although not required, Sacks chose to stay on for an additional year to undertake research, after he had taken a course by <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Macdonald_Sinclair" title="Hugh Macdonald Sinclair">Hugh Macdonald Sinclair</a>. Sacks recalls, "I had been seduced by a series of vivid lectures on the history of medicine" and nutrition, given by Sinclair. Sacks adds, "And now, in Sinclair's lectures, it was the history of physiology, the ideas and personalities of physiologists, which came to life."<sup id="cite_ref-Move_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Move-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> Sacks then became involved with the school's Laboratory of Human Nutrition under Sinclair.

<p>"My pre-med studies in anatomy and physiology at Oxford had not prepared me in the least for real medicine. Seeing patients, listening to them, trying to enter (or at least imagine) their experiences and predicaments, feeling concerned for them, taking responsibility for them, was quite new to me&#160;...

<p>Sacks began medical school in 1956 and for the next two and half years he took courses in medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, dermatology, infectious diseases, obstetrics and various other disciplines. During his years as a student he helped home deliver a number of babies. He received an <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Arts_(Oxbridge_and_Dublin)" title="Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)">MA</a> degree and <a href="/wiki/Bachelor_of_Medicine,_Bachelor_of_Surgery" title="Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery">BM BCh</a> degree in 1958.<sup id="cite_ref-CV_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CV-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup> He qualified for his internship that December, which he would begin at <a href="/wiki/The_Middlesex_Hospital" title="The Middlesex Hospital" class="mw-redirect">The Middlesex Hospital</a> the following month.

</p><p>Sacks considered his literary style to have grown out of the tradition of 19th-century "clinical anecdotes", a literary style that included detailed narrative case histories.

</p><p>Sacks described his cases with a wealth of narrative detail, concentrating on the experiences of the patient (in the case of his <i>A Leg to Stand On</i>, the patient was himself).

</p><p>In November 2012 Sacks' book <i>Hallucinations</i>  was published.

Note also the science fiction aspect to the title of Sacks' book, which frames the disabled people he writes about as "aliens" from a different planet. One issue in the dynamic of the expert who appoints himself as the official storyteller of the experience of disability is that both the professional and financial success of the storyteller often rely upon his framing of the disabled characters as extraordinary, freakish, or abnormal. This is what disability studies scholars and disability advocates term the "medicalization of disability" (Linton 1998, 1–2).</q></cite><span title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AOliver+Sacks&amp;rft.aufirst=Alicia&amp;rft.aulast=Verlager&amp;rft.btitle=Decloaking+Disability%3A+Images+of+Disability+and+Technology+in+Science+Fiction+Media&amp;rft.date=2006-08&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fdspace.mit.edu%2Fhandle%2F1721.1%2F39143&amp;rft.pub=MIT&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook" class="Z3988"><span style="display:none;">&#160;</span></span></span>
