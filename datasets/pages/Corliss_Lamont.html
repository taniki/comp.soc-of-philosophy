The principles that animated his life were first evidenced at Harvard, where he attacked university clubs as snobbery.<sup id="cite_ref-nytobit_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nytobit-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> In 1924 he did graduate work at <a href="/wiki/New_College,_Oxford" title="New College, Oxford">New College</a> <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, where he roomed with <a href="/wiki/Julian_Huxley" title="Julian Huxley">Julian Huxley</a>. The next year Lamont began graduate studies at <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>, where he studied under <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">John Dewey</a>. In 1928 he became a philosophy instructor there and married Margaret Hayes Irish. He received his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1932 from Columbia.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> Lamont taught at Columbia, <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell</a>, Harvard, and the <a href="/wiki/The_New_School" title="The New School">New School for Social Research</a>.
</p><p>He became a radical in the 1930s, moved by the Great Depression. He wrote a book about the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and praised what he saw there: "The people are better dressed, food is good and plentiful, everyone seems confident, happy and full of spirit".<sup id="cite_ref-nytobit_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nytobit-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> He became critical of the Soviets over time, but always thought their achievement in transforming a feudal society remarkable, even as he attacked its treatment of political dissent and lack of civil liberties.<sup id="cite_ref-nytobit_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nytobit-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Lamont's political views were <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Socialist" title="Socialist" class="mw-redirect">socialist</a> for much of his life.
</p><p>Lamont began his 30 years as a director of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union" title="American Civil Liberties Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a> in 1932. In 1934, he was arrested while on a picket line in <a href="/wiki/Jersey_City" title="Jersey City" class="mw-redirect">Jersey City</a>, New Jersey, part of a long battle between labor and civil rights activists and <a href="/wiki/Frank_Hague" title="Frank Hague">Frank Hague</a>, the city's mayor.

</p><p>In 1936, Lamont helped found and subsidized the magazine <i>Marxist Quarterly</i>.

Under the influence of the <a href="/wiki/Popular_Front" title="Popular Front" class="mw-redirect">Popular Front</a>, Lamont and 150 other left-wing writers endorsed Stalin's actions as necessary for "the preservation of progressive democracy". Their letter warned that Dewey's work was itself politically motivated and charged Dewey with supporting reactionary views and "Red-baiting".<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> Lamont wrote an introduction to an anti-Polish pamphlet <i>Behind the Polish-Soviet Break</i> by <a href="/w/index.php?title=Alter_Brody&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Alter Brody (page does not exist)">Alter Brody</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Lamont remained sympathetic to the Soviet Union well after World War II and the establishment of satellite Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe. He authored a pamphlet entitled <i>The Myth of Soviet Aggression</i> in 1952. In it, he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">The fact is, of course, that both the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations, in order to push their enormous armaments programs through Congress and to justify the continuation of the Cold War, have felt compelled to resort to the device of keeping the American people in a state of alarm over some alleged menace of Soviet or Communist origin.
