marx il liberalismo e maledizione di nietzsche quotation quanto detto sin qui può forse bastare non prendere sul serio saggi troppo fortunati ma già quasi avviati al dimenticatoio come fine della storia del nippo-statunitense fukuyama
libro che comunque è stato ampiamente stroncato per le sciocchezze che contiene e non già da tardi epigoni del marxismo-leninismo ma da filosofi 'liberal' come dahrendorf il quale ha anche avuto il buon senso di elencare gli errori di fatto tali da mettere forse il conseguimento della maturità classica! che il troppo fortunato libretto contiene
