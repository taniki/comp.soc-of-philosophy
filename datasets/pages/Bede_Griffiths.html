<p>Griffiths was born in <a href="/wiki/Walton-on-Thames" title="Walton-on-Thames">Walton-on-Thames</a>, Surrey, England, at the end of 1906, the youngest of three children of a middle-class family. Shortly after Griffith's birth, his father was betrayed by a business partner and was left penniless. His mother took the children and established residence in a smaller home which she maintained, though she had to find work to support herself and the children. At age 12, Griffiths was sent to <a href="/wiki/Christ%27s_Hospital" title="Christ's Hospital">Christ's Hospital</a>, a school for poor boys. The students of this school were nicknamed "bluecoats". He excelled in his studies and earned a scholarship to the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> where, in 1925, he began his studies in English literature and philosophy at <a href="/wiki/Magdalen_College,_Oxford" title="Magdalen College, Oxford">Magdalen College</a>. In his third year at university he came under the tutelage of <a href="/wiki/C._S._Lewis" title="C. S. Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, who became a lifelong friend. Griffiths graduated from Oxford in 1929 with a degree in journalism. 
</p><p>Shortly after graduation, Griffiths and two friends settled in a cottage in the <a href="/wiki/Cotswold" title="Cotswold" class="mw-redirect">Cotswold</a> region and began what he called an "experiment in common living".<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> They followed a lifestyle attuned to nature, milking cows and selling the milk to support themselves. They would read the Bible together as a form of literature. Griffiths noted a strong connection between the teachings of <a href="/wiki/Scripture" title="Scripture" class="mw-redirect">Scripture</a> and the rhythm of the nature around them. The experiment lasted less than a year, as one of the friends found the life too demanding. Nevertheless, the experience had a strong effect on Griffiths.
</p><p>As a result of this experience, Griffiths decided to seek <a href="/wiki/Holy_Orders" title="Holy Orders" class="mw-redirect">Holy Orders</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. He was advised, however, to gain some experience in the slums of London. This advice was so contrary to what Griffiths felt to be his <a href="/wiki/Vocation" title="Vocation">vocation</a> that it drove him to a crisis of faith, which nearly drove him to an emotional breakdown.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Guided by the writings of <a href="/wiki/Cardinal_Newman" title="Cardinal Newman" class="mw-redirect">Cardinal Newman</a>, he reached a point in this struggle where he had a spiritual breakthrough. He recounts the story of his conversion in his autobiography <i>The Golden String</i>.
</p><p>In November 1931, Griffiths went to stay at the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_St._Benedict" title="Order of St. Benedict" class="mw-redirect">Benedictine</a> <a href="/wiki/Monastery" title="Monastery">monastery</a> of <a href="/wiki/Prinknash_Abbey" title="Prinknash Abbey">Prinknash Abbey</a> where he was impressed by the life. Despite the strong anti-Roman Catholic sentiments of his mother, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church and made his <a href="/wiki/First_Communion" title="First Communion">First Communion</a> at Christmas Eve <a href="/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)" title="Mass (liturgy)">Mass</a> at the abbey.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Benedictine_monastic_life">Benedictine monastic life</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Bede_Griffiths&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Benedictine monastic life">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Griffiths was received by the abbey as a <a href="/wiki/Postulant" title="Postulant">postulant</a> a month after his reception into the Catholic Church. On 29 December 1932, he entered the <a href="/wiki/Novitiate" title="Novitiate">novitiate</a> and was given the monastic name of "Bede". He made his solemn <a href="/wiki/Profession" title="Profession">profession</a> in 1937 (a year before the death of his mother in a car accident) and was <a href="/wiki/Ordained" title="Ordained" class="mw-redirect">ordained</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Catholic_priesthood" title="Catholic priesthood" class="mw-redirect">Catholic priesthood</a> in 1940. 
</p><p>In 1947 the abbey sent a group of 25 monks to give support to two monasteries in the United Kingdom which had been founded by monks from France. Griffiths was chosen to be the <a href="/wiki/Prior" title="Prior">obedientiary prior</a> for the monastery at <a href="/wiki/St_Michael%27s_Abbey,_Farnborough" title="St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough">Farnborough</a> in Hampshire. He led that house for four years, but was unable to generate sufficient financial support to keep the community going. The abbot then sent him to the other monastery, <a href="/wiki/Pluscarden_Abbey" title="Pluscarden Abbey">Pluscarden Abbey</a> in Scotland. It was there that he wrote his autobiography.
</p><p>During Griffiths' time at Farnborough, he had come to know Father Benedict Alapatt, a European-born monk of Indian descent who was greatly interested in establishing a monastery in his homeland. Griffiths had already been introduced to Eastern thought, <a href="/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">yoga</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Vedas" title="Vedas">Vedas</a> and took interest in this proposed project. The abbot at first refused permission. Later, however, he changed his mind and authorised Griffiths to go to India with the Indian member of the community. There was one condition, though: Griffiths was not to be there as a member of the abbey, but as a priest subject to a local bishop, which meant that he would be giving up his vows.

<p>After some painful inner debate, Griffith agreed to this and, in 1955, he embarked for India with Alapatt. At the time, he wrote to a friend: "I am going to discover the other half of my soul."<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

That project was eventually unsuccessful as Griffiths left the location in 1958, saying that he found it "too Western".<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>Griffiths then joined with a <a href="/wiki/Belgian_people" title="Belgian people" class="mw-redirect">Belgian</a> monk, Father <a href="/wiki/Francis_Acharya" title="Francis Acharya">Francis Acharya</a>, <a href="/wiki/Trappists" title="Trappists">OCSO</a>, to establish <a href="/wiki/Kristiya_Sanyasa_Samaj,Kurisumala_Ashram" title="Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj,Kurisumala Ashram" class="mw-redirect">Kristiya Sanyasa Samaj, Kurisumala Ashram</a> ("Mountain of the Cross"), a <a href="/wiki/Syriac_Christianity" title="Syriac Christianity">Syriac Rite</a> monastery of the <a href="/wiki/Syro-Malankara_Catholic_Church" title="Syro-Malankara Catholic Church">Syro-Malankara Catholic Church</a> in Kerala. They sought to develop a form of monastic life based in the Indian tradition, adopting the <a href="/wiki/Saffron" title="Saffron">saffron</a> garments of an Indian <i><a href="/wiki/Sannyasi" title="Sannyasi" class="mw-redirect">sannyasi</a></i> (an <a href="/wiki/Ascetic" title="Ascetic" class="mw-redirect">ascetic</a> or monk). At that point, Griffiths took the <a href="/wiki/Sanskrit" title="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> name "<b>Dayananda</b>" ("bliss of compassion"). During that time he continued his studies in the religions and cultures of India, writing <i>Christ in India</i> while there. He also visited the United States during the period, giving a number of talks about East–West dialogue and being interviewed by <a href="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> television.
</p><p>Later, in 1968, Griffiths moved to the Saccidananda Ashram (also known as <i>Shantivanam</i>; <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> for "forest of peace") in <a href="/wiki/Tamil_Nadu" title="Tamil Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, South India,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> which had been founded in 1950 by the French Benedictine monk <a href="/wiki/Abhishiktananda" title="Abhishiktananda">Abhishiktananda</a> (Dom Henri Le&#160;Saux, OSB), from the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Abbey_of_Kergonan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Abbey of Kergonan (page does not exist)">Abbey of Kergonan</a>, along with another Frenchman, the <a href="/wiki/Abb%C3%A9" title="Abbé">Abbé</a> Jules Monchanin. The two had developed a religious lifestyle which was completely expressed in authentic Indian fashion, using English, Sanskrit and <a href="/wiki/Tamil_language" title="Tamil language">Tamil</a> in their religious services. They had built the ashram buildings by hand in the style of the poor of the country. Monchanin had died in 1957 and Le&#160;Saux wanted to devote himself to a <a href="/wiki/Hermit" title="Hermit">hermit</a>'s life. Griffiths came with two other monks to assume life there and to allow Le&#160;Saux his wish.
</p><p>Griffiths resumed his studies of Indian thought, trying to relate it to Christian theology. At this point, he became known as "<b>Swami Dayananda</b>" ("bliss of compassion"). He wrote 12 books on <a href="/wiki/Hindu" title="Hindu">Hindu</a>–Christian dialogue. During this period, Griffiths desired to reconnect himself with the Benedictine order and sought a monastic <a href="/wiki/Congregation_(Catholic)" title="Congregation (Catholic)">congregation</a> which would accept him in the way of life he had developed over the decades. He was welcomed by the <a href="/wiki/Camaldolese" title="Camaldolese">Camaldolese</a> monks, and he and the ashram became a part of their congregation.
</p>
Griffiths was a proponent of <a href="/wiki/Integral_thought" title="Integral thought" class="mw-redirect">integral thought</a>, which attempts to harmonise scientific and spiritual world views. In a 1983 interview he stated, <blockquote>We're now being challenged to create a theology which would use the findings of modern science and eastern mysticism which, as you know, coincide so much, and to evolve from that a new theology which would be much more adequate.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>In January 1990, Griffiths suffered a stroke in his room at the ashram. A month later, to the day, he was declared healed. The following year, he began a period of extensive travel, making annual visits to the United States, then later to Europe, where he met the <a href="/wiki/Dalai_Lama" title="Dalai Lama">Dalai Lama</a>. He noted to a friend, "I do believe that he liked me."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> He continued his journey, giving lectures in Germany and England. He arrived back at the ashram in October 1992, where an Australian film crew were awaiting him to make a documentary about his life, which was released as <i>A Human Search</i>.
</p><p>Three days after the completion of filming, on his 86th birthday, Griffiths had a major stroke. The following month, he had a further series of strokes. He died at Shantivanam on 13 May 1993, aged 86.
