Born in <a href="/wiki/Guildford" title="Guildford">Guildford</a>, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at <a href="/wiki/Dulwich_College" title="Dulwich College">Dulwich College</a>, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly <a href="/wiki/School_story" title="School story">school stories</a>, but he later switched to comic fiction, creating several regular characters who became familiar to the public over the years. They include the feather-brained <a href="/wiki/Bertie_Wooster" title="Bertie Wooster">Bertie Wooster</a> and his sagacious valet, <a href="/wiki/Jeeves" title="Jeeves">Jeeves</a>; the immaculate and loquacious <a href="/wiki/Psmith" title="Psmith">Psmith</a>; the feeble-minded <a href="/wiki/Lord_Emsworth" title="Lord Emsworth">Lord Emsworth</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Blandings_Castle" title="Blandings Castle">Blandings Castle</a> set; the loquacious <a href="/wiki/Oldest_Member_(character)" title="Oldest Member (character)">Oldest Member</a>, with stories about golf; and the equally loquacious <a href="/wiki/Mr_Mulliner" title="Mr Mulliner" class="mw-redirect">Mr Mulliner</a>, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.
</p><p>Although most of Wodehouse's fiction is set in England, he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories. During and after the First World War, together with <a href="/wiki/Guy_Bolton" title="Guy Bolton">Guy Bolton</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jerome_Kern" title="Jerome Kern">Jerome Kern</a>, he wrote a series of <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> musical comedies that were an important part of the development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for <a href="/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance at Hollywood studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.
</p><p>In 1934 Wodehouse moved to France for tax reasons; in 1940 he was taken prisoner at <a href="/wiki/Le_Touquet" title="Le Touquet">Le Touquet</a> by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death he lived in the US, taking dual British-American citizenship in 1955. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in <a href="/wiki/Southampton,_New_York" title="Southampton, New York">Southampton</a>, New York.
</p><p>Wodehouse worked extensively on his books, sometimes having two or more in preparation simultaneously. He would take up to two years to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of <a href="/wiki/Edwardian_era" title="Edwardian era">Edwardian</a> slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.

<p>In 1901, with the help of a former Dulwich master, <a href="/wiki/William_Beach_Thomas" title="William Beach Thomas">William Beach Thomas</a>, Wodehouse secured an appointment—at first temporary and later permanent—writing for <i><a href="/wiki/The_Globe_(London_newspaper)" title="The Globe (London newspaper)">The Globe</a>'</i>s popular "By the Way" column.

<p>A third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer <a href="/wiki/Guy_Bolton" title="Guy Bolton">Guy Bolton</a>, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator.

The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was <i>Miss Springtime</i> (1916), which ran for 227 performances—a good run by the standards of the day.

<p>The contract started in May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, and he had spare time to write a novel and nine short stories. He commented, "It's odd how soon one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary."<sup id="cite_ref-wd125_102-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wd125-102">[87]</a></sup> Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that <i><a href="/wiki/Those_Three_French_Girls" title="Those Three French Girls">Those Three French Girls</a></i> (1930) was "as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced."<sup id="cite_ref-103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-103">[88]</a></sup>
</p><p>When Wodehouse's contract ended after a year it was not renewed. At MGM's request, he gave an interview to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Los_Angeles_Times" title="The Los Angeles Times" class="mw-redirect">The Los Angeles Times</a></i>. Wodehouse, who was described by <a href="/wiki/Herbert_Warren_Wind" title="Herbert Warren Wind">Herbert Warren Wind</a> as "politically naive [and] fundamentally unworldly",<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104">[89]</a></sup> caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood's inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, and there was much editorial comment about the state of the film industry.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105">[90]</a></sup> Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system,<sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-106">[91]</a></sup> but Taves believes it to have been "a storm in a teacup", and Donaldson comments that in the straitened post-crash era the reforms would sooner or later have been inevitable.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107">[92]</a></sup>
</p><p>Wind's view of Wodehouse's naïveté is not universally held.

<p>During the 1930s Wodehouse's theatrical work tailed off.

<p>The broadcasts, in point of fact, are neither anti- nor pro-German, but just Wodehousian. He is a man singularly ill-fitted to live in a time of ideological conflict, having no feelings of hatred about anyone, and no very strong views about anything.&#160;... I never heard him speak bitterly about anyone—not even about old friends who turned against him in distress.

<p>The Wodehouses remained in Germany until September 1943, when Allied bombing led to the couple being allowed to move back to Paris.

On 28 September Cussen filed his report, which states that in regard to the broadcasts, Wodehouse's behaviour "has been unwise", but advised against further action.

</p><p>In November 1944 Duff Cooper was appointed British ambassador to France<sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[149]</a></sup> and was provided accommodation at the <a href="/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_Le_Bristol_Paris" title="Hôtel Le Bristol Paris">Hôtel Le Bristol</a>, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper complained to the French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel.<sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[150]</a></sup> They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, he managed to get Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained.

<p>Having secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made preparations to return to New York.

Wodehouse stayed with them frequently, and in 1952 he and Ethel bought a house nearby. They lived at Remsenburg for the rest of their lives. Between 1952 and 1975 he published more than twenty novels, as well as two collections of short stories, a heavily edited collection of his letters, a volume of memoirs, and a selection of his magazine articles.<sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[n 28]</a></sup> He continued to hanker after a revival of his theatrical career.

<p>Before starting a book Wodehouse would write up to four hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that "It's the plots that I find so hard to work out.

<p>In 1941 the <i>Concise Cambridge History of English Literature</i> opined that Wodehouse had "a gift for highly original aptness of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce",<sup id="cite_ref-219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-219">[190]</a></sup> while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine "high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style", particularly in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Code_of_the_Woosters" title="The Code of the Woosters">The Code of the Woosters</a></i>;<sup id="cite_ref-McCrum_lang_216-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McCrum_lang-216">[187]</a></sup> the novelist <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Powell" title="Anthony Powell">Anthony Powell</a> believes Wodehouse to be a "comic poet".<sup id="cite_ref-220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-220">[191]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Robert_A._Hall,_Jr." title="Robert A. Hall, Jr.">Robert A. Hall, Jr.</a>, in his study of Wodehouse's style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose,<sup id="cite_ref-Gage_CA_37-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gage_CA-37">[33]</a></sup> an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse "one of the finest and purest writers of English prose".<sup id="cite_ref-221" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-221">[192]</a></sup> Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character "de-Beaned the cupboard". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides "hobnobbing" when he writes: "To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing."<sup id="cite_ref-Gage_CA_37-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gage_CA-37">[33]</a></sup>

<p>"&#8201;'It seems to me, Jeeves, that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest.'<br />
'Yes, sir.'<br />
'What, in your opinion, will the harvest be?'<br />

</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The stylistic device most commonly found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate "resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous". Examples can be seen in <i>Joy in the Morning</i>, Chapter 29: "There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action", or <i>Psmith</i>, Chapter 7: "A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation."<sup id="cite_ref-Gage_CA_37-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gage_CA-37">[33]</a></sup> Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a <a href="/wiki/Hypallage" title="Hypallage">transferred epithet</a>, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.<sup id="cite_ref-Transferred_Epithet_225-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Transferred_Epithet-225">[196]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote><div class="poem">
<p>"I balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on the teaspoon."<br />

—<i><a href="/wiki/Jeeves_and_the_Feudal_Spirit" title="Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit">Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit</a></i>, Chapter 1<br />

</div></blockquote>
<p>Wordplay is a key element in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in <i>Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit</i>, when Bertie is released after a night in the police cells, and says that he has "a pinched look" about him.<sup id="cite_ref-Gage_CA_37-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gage_CA-37">[33]</a></sup> Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in <i>Uncle Dynamite</i> when Constable Potter says he has been "assaulted by the duck pond." In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word "by", asks: "How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?"<sup id="cite_ref-Gage_CA_37-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gage_CA-37">[33]</a></sup> Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as <a href="/wiki/Bingo_Little" title="Bingo Little">Bingo Little</a>'s infant child who "not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail", or Wooster's complaint that "the rumpuses that <a href="/wiki/Bobbie_Wickham" title="Bobbie Wickham">Bobbie Wickham</a> is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup."<sup id="cite_ref-226" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-226">[197]</a></sup> Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In <i>Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit</i> Bertie asks Jeeves "Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and&#160;... what's the word? Something about cats." Jeeves replies, "Cataclysms, sir?"<sup id="cite_ref-Gage_CA_37-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Gage_CA-37">[33]</a></sup>

<p>Wodehouse's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to <i>The Guardian</i>, "was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy".<sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[198]</a></sup> At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning £40,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories.<sup id="cite_ref-Guardian:_Barker_228-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Guardian:_Barker-228">[199]</a></sup> Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i> stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity—and the sales figures—slowly recovered over time.<sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[200]</a></sup>

<p>Wodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A.E. Housman<sup id="cite_ref-dnb_18-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dnb-18">[16]</a></sup> and Evelyn Waugh—the last of whom opines: "One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page."<sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[201]</a></sup> There are dissenters to the praise.

"Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art."<sup id="cite_ref-233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-233">[204]</a></sup>
