<p>Curti was born in <a href="/wiki/Papillion,_Nebraska" title="Papillion, Nebraska">Papillion, Nebraska</a>, a suburb of <a href="/wiki/Omaha" title="Omaha" class="mw-redirect">Omaha</a>, on September 15, 1897. His parents were John Eugene Curti, an immigrant from <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, and Alice Hunt, a <a href="/wiki/Yankee" title="Yankee">Yankee</a> from <a href="/wiki/Vermont" title="Vermont">Vermont</a>. Curti attended high school in Omaha then obtained a bachelor's degree in 1920 from <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>, graduating <i>summa cum laude</i>. He then spent a year studying in <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> where he met Margaret Wooster, 1898-1963, who had a Ph.D. from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> and was a pioneer in research on <a href="/wiki/Child_psychology" title="Child psychology" class="mw-redirect">child psychology</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>  They married in 1925 and had two daughters.  Curti received his Ph.D. in 1927 from Harvard as one of the last students of <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Jackson_Turner" title="Frederick Jackson Turner">Frederick Jackson Turner</a>.
</p><p>Curti taught at <a href="/wiki/Beloit_College" title="Beloit College">Beloit College</a>, <a href="/wiki/Smith_College" title="Smith College">Smith College</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a>, then in 1942 he joined the faculty of the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin-Madison" title="University of Wisconsin-Madison" class="mw-redirect">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, where he taught for 25 years.  He also taught in <a href="/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, and lectured throughout <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>.

<p>While at Smith College, Curti published his first book, <i>The American Peace Crusade, 1815-1860</i> (1929).  The book, based on his dissertation, was written after <a href="/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger,_Sr." title="Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.">Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.</a> (who had replaced Turner at Harvard) rejected his first dissertation proposal which was essentially an early version of <i>The Growth of American Thought.</i>

<p>Moving to <a href="/wiki/Teachers_College" title="Teachers College" class="mw-redirect">Teachers College</a> at Columbia in 1931, he published a book on <a href="/wiki/William_Jennings_Bryan" title="William Jennings Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> and world peace (<i>Bryan and World Peace</i>). It was followed by <i>Peace or War: The American Struggle</i> in 1936. With these works, Curti helped found <a href="/wiki/Peace_and_conflict_studies" title="Peace and conflict studies">peace and conflict studies</a> as a field of study. He criticized pacifists for ignoring major social changes—especially the  repudiation of old-fashioned competitive capitalism by the <a href="/wiki/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>, and the need to repudiate imperial greed if peace were to be achieved. In 1964 he helped found the Conference on Peace Research in History, now called the Peace History Society. <i>The Roots of American Loyalty</i> (1946) was a history of patriotism.
</p><p>Curti developed his global vision through travels; he taught in Japan, Australia and India for two years. He left the Episcopal faith of his boyhood for Unitarianism. Although never a Marxist, he voted for Socialist presidential candidates in the name of world peace.

<p>Curti turned his attention to <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_history" title="Intellectual history">intellectual history</a>, and helped to establish that field as a distinct academic discipline. His first foray in the field was <i>The Social Ideals of American Educators,</i> published in 1935. In 1944, Curti won the Pulitzer Prize in history for his masterwork, <i>The Growth of American Thought.</i> Its chapters show an encyclopedic knowledge of thinkers great and small from the colonial period to the present, together with his commitment to democracy as a process springing from the ideas of the people. Curti adapted <a href="/wiki/Frontier_Thesis" title="Frontier Thesis">Turner's frontier thesis</a> to intellectual history, arguing, "Because the American environment, physical and social, differed from that of Europe, Americans, confronted by different needs and problems, adapted the European intellectual heritage in their own way. And because American life came increasingly to differ from European life, American ideas, American agencies of intellectual life, and the use made of knowledge likewise came to differ in America from their European counterparts." (p vi)  Unlike some of the other leaders of the American Studies program, he paid little attention to myths and symbols. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Perry_Miller" title="Perry Miller">Perry Miller</a> at Harvard, who strongly influenced a new generation of intellectual historians, Curti never delved too deeply into the internal history of ideas, preferring to link them to multiple external social and economic factors. His book was not so much a history of American thought as a social history of American thought, with strong attention to the social and economic forces that shaped that thought from the bottom up.

<p>In the 1950s Curti undertook a collaborative social history of rural <a href="/wiki/Trempealeau_County,_Wisconsin" title="Trempealeau County, Wisconsin">Trempealeau County</a>, Wisconsin using avant-garde quantitative analysis of census records. The book which came out of the project, <i>The Making of an American Community: A Case Study of Democracy in a Frontier County</i> (1959) immediately became a pioneer work in what would soon be dubbed the <a href="/wiki/Social_history" title="Social history">"new social history."</a> Curti's wife Margaret Wooster Curti, provided some of the quantitative methodology. Historians, however, did not emulate it, preferring instead to follow <a href="/wiki/Stephan_Thernstrom" title="Stephan Thernstrom">Stephan Thernstrom</a>'s model in <i>Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth-Century American City</i> (1964), which used a similar methodology of tracking workers through their careers using censuses and city directories. The difference was urban and rural—urban history was exploding and rural history was a backwater; in addition the Thernstrom model was easier to replicate by a graduate student writing a PhD thesis alone (Curti had numerous research assistants and coauthors). Whereas the "old" social history comprised descriptions of everyday lifestyles, perhaps with a coverage of grass roots political movements (like the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Party_(United_States)" title="People's Party (United States)">Populists</a>), Curti's "new" social history was a systematic examination of the entire population using statistics and social science methodologies.

<p>In 1942 Curti was called to the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Frederick_Jackson_Turner_Professorship_of_History&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Frederick Jackson Turner Professorship of History (page does not exist)">Frederick Jackson Turner Professorship of History</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin" title="University of Wisconsin" class="mw-redirect">University of Wisconsin</a>, one of the nation's top three or four most influential centers of historical scholarship; he retired from the department in 1968. 
He continued to write after retirement, keeping up-to-date his influential textbook <i>Rise of the American Nation</i><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> (1st ed. 1950), coauthored with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Lewis_Todd&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lewis Todd (page does not exist)">Lewis Todd</a>, which goes through many editions even after their deaths.
</p><p>The Wisconsin department of history was notorious for the angry feuds among the senior professors, which Curti, mild-mannered and small of stature completely ignored.  Curti supervised 86 finished doctoral dissertations at Columbia and Wisconsin, including many who became famous scholars: <a href="/wiki/Richard_Hofstadter" title="Richard Hofstadter">Richard Hofstadter</a> on <a href="/wiki/Social_Darwinism" title="Social Darwinism">Social Darwinism</a>; <a href="/wiki/John_Higham" title="John Higham">John Higham</a> on nativism; Bourke on community studies; <a href="/wiki/Allen_Davis" title="Allen Davis" class="mw-disambig">Allen Davis</a> on Progressivism and Jane Addams; and <a href="/wiki/Roderick_Nash" title="Roderick Nash">Roderick Nash</a> on the environment.  Curti allowed his students a free hand in content and methodology. He encouraged his students constantly, wrote highly detailed critiques of their chapters, protected them from intradepartmental feuds, helped them get funding, and found them jobs through the "old boys" network of which he was an accomplished maestro, writing hundreds of letters a month to friends and ex-students across the globe.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>
