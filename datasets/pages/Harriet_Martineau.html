<p>The sixth of eight children, Harriet Martineau was born in <a href="/wiki/Norwich" title="Norwich">Norwich</a>, England, where her father was a textile manufacturer.<sup id="cite_ref-spartacus-educational.com_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-spartacus-educational.com-5">[5]</a></sup> Her mother was the daughter of a sugar refiner and a grocer. The <a href="/wiki/Martineau_family" title="Martineau family">Martineau family</a> was of French <a href="/wiki/Huguenot" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> ancestry and professed <a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" title="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> views. Her uncle was the surgeon Philip Meadows Martineau (1752–1829), whom she had enjoyed visiting at his nearby estate, <a href="/wiki/Carrow_Abbey" title="Carrow Abbey">Bracondale Lodge</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Martineau was closest to her brother <a href="/wiki/James_Martineau" title="James Martineau">James</a>, who became a clergyman in the tradition of the <a href="/wiki/English_Dissenters" title="English Dissenters">English Dissenters</a>. According to the writer Diana Postlethwaite, Harriet's relationship with her mother was strained and lacking affection, which contributed to views expressed in her later writing.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> Martineau claimed her mother abandoned her to a <a href="/wiki/Wet_nurse" title="Wet nurse">wet nurse</a>.
</p><p>Her ideals on domesticity and the "natural faculty for housewifery", as described in her book <i>Household Education</i> (1848),<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> stemmed from her lack of nurture growing up. Her mother was the antithesis of the warm and nurturing qualities which Harriet believed to be necessary for girls at an early age. Her mother urged all her children to be well-read, but at the same time opposed female pedantics "with a sharp eye for feminine propriety and good manners. Her daughters could never be seen in public with a pen in their hand." Her mother strictly enforced proper feminine behaviour, pushing her daughter to "hold a sewing needle" as well as the pen.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Martineau began losing her senses of taste and smell at a young age, becoming increasingly deaf and having to use an <a href="/wiki/Ear_trumpet" title="Ear trumpet">ear trumpet</a>. It was the beginning of many health problems in her life. In 1821 she began to write anonymously for the <i><a href="/wiki/Monthly_Repository" title="Monthly Repository">Monthly Repository</a></i>, a Unitarian periodical, and in 1823 she published <i>Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns</i>. Her father's business failed in 1829. At 27 years old, Martineau stepped out of feminine propriety to earn a living for her family. Along with her needlework, she began selling her articles to the <i>Monthly Repository</i>, earning accolades, including three essay prizes from the <a href="/wiki/Unitarian_Association" title="Unitarian Association" class="mw-redirect">Unitarian Association</a>. Her regular work with the <i>Repository</i> helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.
</p><p>In Harriet Martineau's <i>Autobiography</i>, she reflects on her success as a writer and her father's business failure, which she describes as "one of the best things that ever happened to us." Since, she can "truly live instead of vegetate."<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Her reflection emphasizes her experience with financial responsibility in her life while she writes "[her] fusion of literary and economic narratives."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Her first commissioned book, <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Illustrations_of_Political_Economy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Illustrations of Political Economy (page does not exist)">Illustrations of Political Economy</a></i>,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> was a fictional tutorial intended to help the general public understand the ideas of <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>. <i>Illustrations</i> was published in February 1832 in an edition of just 1500, since the publisher assumed it would not sell well.  Yet it very quickly became highly successful, and would steadily out-sell the work of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Dickens" title="Charles Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>. <i>Illustrations</i> was her first work to receive widespread acclaim, and its success served to spread the free-market ideas of Adam Smith and others throughout the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>. Martineau then agreed to compose a series of similar monthly stories over a period of two years, the work being hastened by having her brother James also work on the series with her.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> The subsequent works offered fictional tutorials on a range of political economists such as <a href="/wiki/James_Mill" title="James Mill">James Mill</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham" title="Jeremy Bentham">Bentham</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Ricardo" title="David Ricardo">Ricardo</a>, the latter especially forming her view of rent law.  Most notoriously today, Martineau relied on <a href="/wiki/Malthus" title="Malthus" class="mw-redirect">Malthus</a> to form her view of population, though in stories such as "Weal and Woe in Garvelock" she promoted the idea of <a href="/wiki/Population_control" title="Population control">population control</a> only via genteel notions of <a href="/wiki/Sexual_abstinence#History" title="Sexual abstinence">voluntary chastity</a> and older marriages.

<p>In the Victorian era, most social institutions and norms were strongly shaped by gender, or the perception of what was "appropriate" for men versus for women. Writing was no exception; non-fiction works about social, economic and political issues were dominated by men, while limited areas, such as romance fiction, and topics dealing with domesticity were considered to be appropriate for women authors.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Despite these gendered expectations in the literary world, Martineau strongly expressed her opinions on a variety of topics. In 1832 Martineau moved to London. Among her acquaintances were: <a href="/wiki/Henry_Hallam" title="Henry Hallam">Henry Hallam</a>, <a href="/wiki/Harriet_Taylor" title="Harriet Taylor" class="mw-redirect">Harriet Taylor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Maconochie_(penal_reformer)" title="Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)">Alexander Maconochie</a>, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Hart_Milman" title="Henry Hart Milman">Henry Hart Milman</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus" class="mw-redirect">Thomas Malthus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Monckton_Milnes" title="Monckton Milnes" class="mw-redirect">Monckton Milnes</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Smith" title="Sydney Smith">Sydney Smith</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill" title="John Stuart Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Eliot" title="George Eliot">George Eliot</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edward_George_Bulwer-Lytton" title="Edward George Bulwer-Lytton" class="mw-redirect">Edward George Bulwer-Lytton</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett_Browning" title="Elizabeth Barrett Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sarah_Austin_(translator)" title="Sarah Austin (translator)">Sarah Austin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Charles_Lyell" title="Charles Lyell">Charles Lyell</a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Jane_Welsh_Carlyle" title="Jane Welsh Carlyle">Jane Welsh Carlyle</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Carlyle" title="Thomas Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a>. She met <a href="/wiki/Florence_Nightingale" title="Florence Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a> and <a href="/wiki/Charlotte_Bront%C3%AB" title="Charlotte Brontë">Charlotte Brontë</a> later on in her literary career.
</p><p>Until 1834 Martineau was occupied with her brother James on the <a href="/wiki/Political_economy" title="Political economy">political economy</a> series, as well as with work a supplemental series of <i>Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and Illustrations of Taxation</i> which was intended to directly influence government policy. About the same time, she published four stories expressing support of the <a href="/wiki/British_Whig_Party" title="British Whig Party" class="mw-redirect">Whig</a> <a href="/wiki/Poor_Law" title="Poor Law" class="mw-redirect">Poor Law</a> reforms. These tales (direct, lucid, written without any appearance of effort, and yet practically effective) display the characteristics of their author's style. <a href="/wiki/Tory" title="Tory">Tory</a> paternalists reacted by calling her a <a href="/wiki/Malthusian" title="Malthusian" class="mw-redirect">Malthusian</a> "who deprecates charity and provision for the poor", while <a href="/wiki/Radicalism_(historical)" title="Radicalism (historical)">Radicals</a> opposed her to the same degree. Whig <a href="/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">high society</a> fêted her.<sup id="cite_ref-bell_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bell-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>In May 1834 <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, on his expedition to the <a href="/wiki/Galapagos_Islands" title="Galapagos Islands" class="mw-redirect">Galapagos Islands</a>, received a letter from his sisters saying that Martineau was "now a great Lion in London, much patronized by Ld.

They added that their brother <a href="/wiki/Erasmus_Alvey_Darwin" title="Erasmus Alvey Darwin">Erasmus</a> "knows her &amp; is a very great admirer &amp; every body reads her little books &amp; if you have a dull hour you can, and then throw them overboard, that they may not take up your precious room."<sup id="cite_ref-Letter_224_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Letter_224-12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>In 1834, after completing the economic series, Harriet Martineau paid a long visit to the United States. During this time, she visited with <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a>, the former president, at his home at <a href="/wiki/Montpelier_(Orange,_Virginia)" title="Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)">Montpelier</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> She also met numerous abolitionists in Boston and studied the emerging girls' schools established for their education.  Her support of <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">abolitionism</a>, then widely unpopular across the U.S., caused controversy, which her publication, soon after her return, of <i>Society in America</i> (1837) and <i>How to Observe Morals and Manners</i> (1838), only added to. The two books are considered significant contributions to the then-emerging field of sociology.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>In <i>Society in America</i>, Martineau angrily criticised the state of women's education. She wrote,
</p>
<blockquote>"The intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction of... education... As women have none of the objects in life for which an enlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given... The choice is to either be 'ill-educated, passive, and subservient, or well-educated, vigorous, and free only upon sufferance."<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>The publication of Harriet Martineau's <i>Illustrations of Political Economy</i> found public success. So much success that, "by 1834, the monthly sales . . . had reached 10,000, several times that of many Dicken's novels, which at 2,000 or 2,000 per month were considered highly successful"<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
<p>Her article "The Martyr Age of the United States" (1839), in the <i><a href="/wiki/Westminster_Review" title="Westminster Review">Westminster Review</a></i>, introduced English readers to the struggles of the abolitionists in America several years after Britain had <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Abolitionism in the United Kingdom">abolished slavery</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>In October 1836, soon after returning from the <a href="/wiki/Second_voyage_of_HMS_Beagle" title="Second voyage of HMS Beagle">voyage of the <i>Beagle</i></a>, Charles Darwin went to London to stay with his brother <a href="/wiki/Erasmus_Alvey_Darwin" title="Erasmus Alvey Darwin">Erasmus</a>. He found him spending his days "driving out Miss Martineau", who had returned from her trip to the United States. Charles wrote to his sister, 
</p>
<blockquote>"Our only protection from so admirable a sister-in-law is in her working him too hard." He commented, "She already takes him to task about his idleness— She is going some day to explain to him her notions about marriage— Perfect equality of rights is part of her doctrine. I much doubt whether it will be equality in practice."<sup id="cite_ref-www.darwinproject.ac.uk_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-www.darwinproject.ac.uk-16">[16]</a></sup></blockquote>The Darwins shared Martineau's Unitarian background and Whig politics, but their father <a href="/wiki/Robert_Waring_Darwin" title="Robert Waring Darwin" class="mw-redirect">Robert</a> was concerned that, as a potential daughter-in-law, the writer was too extreme in her politics.  Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece read in the <i>Westminster Review</i> calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote "before he knew it was not hers [Martineau's], and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers."<sup id="cite_ref-Desmond_1991_205_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Desmond_1991_205-17">[17]</a></sup> In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book <i>Society in America</i>, including the "grandeur and beauty" of the "process of world making" she had seen at <a href="/wiki/Niagara_Falls" title="Niagara Falls">Niagara Falls</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Desmond_1991_205_17-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Desmond_1991_205-17">[17]</a></sup> He remarked in a letter, <blockquote>She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman.<sup id="cite_ref-Letter_325_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Letter_325-18">[18]</a></sup></blockquote>In April 1838 Charles wrote to his older sister Susan that 
<blockquote>Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night:—if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would loose it.— Lyell called there the other day &amp; there was a beautiful rose on the table, &amp; she coolly showed it to him &amp; said 'Erasmus Darwin' gave me that.— How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman.<sup id="cite_ref-Letter_407_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Letter_407-19">[19]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Martineau wrote <i>Deerbrook</i> (1838), a <a href="/wiki/Three-volume_novel" title="Three-volume novel">three-volume novel</a> published after her American books.  She portrayed a failed love affair between a physician and his sister-in-law. It was considered her most successful novel.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> She also wrote <i>The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance</i> (1839), a three-volume novel about the Haitian slave leader <a href="/wiki/Toussaint_L%27Ouverture" title="Toussaint L'Ouverture" class="mw-redirect">Toussaint L'Ouverture</a>, who contributed to the island nation's gaining independence in 1804.

<p>In 1839, during a visit to <a href="/wiki/Continental_Europe" title="Continental Europe">Continental Europe</a>, Martineau was diagnosed with a uterine tumor.  She several times visited her brother-in-law, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Michael_Greenhow" title="Thomas Michael Greenhow">Thomas Michael Greenhow</a>, who was a celebrated doctor in <a href="/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne" title="Newcastle upon Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a>, to try to alleviate her symptoms.  On the last occasion she stayed for six months in the Greenhow family house at 28 Eldon Square. Immobile and confined to a couch, she was cared for by her mother until purchasing a house and hiring a nurse to aid her.
</p><p>She next moved downriver to <a href="/wiki/Tynemouth" title="Tynemouth">Tynemouth</a>, where she stayed at Mrs Halliday's boarding-house, 57 Front Street, for nearly five years from 16 March 1840. The establishment is still open as a guest house today, now named the <i>Martineau Guest House</i> in her honour.

The critic Diana Postlethwaite wrote of this period for Martineau: <blockquote>Being homebound is a major part of the process of becoming feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... doing these things. They define femininity for her.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup></blockquote>Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.
<p>Martineau wrote at least three books during her illness, and a historical plaque marks this house. A book of short stories for children, <i>The Playfellow</i>, was published in 1841.<sup id="cite_ref-spartacus-educational.com_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-spartacus-educational.com-5">[5]</a></sup> In 1844 she published both <i>Crofton Boys</i>, a children's novel, and <i>Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid,</i> an autobiographical reflection on invalidism. She wrote <i>Household Education</i> (1848), the handbook on the "proper" way to raise and educate children. Lastly, she began working on her autobiography.  Completed much later, it included some hundred pages to this period. Notable visitors included Richard Cobden and Thomas and Jane Carlyle.
</p><p><i>Life in the Sickroom</i> is considered to be one of Martineau's most under-rated works. It upset evangelical readers as they "thought it dangerous in 'its supposition of self-reliance'".<sup id="cite_ref-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616-20">[20]</a></sup> This series of essays embraced traditional womanhood. Martineau dedicated it to <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Barrett" title="Elizabeth Barrett" class="mw-redirect">Elizabeth Barrett</a>, as it was "an outpouring of feeling to an idealized female alter ego, both professional writer and professional invalid- and utterly unlike the women in her own family". Written during a kind of public break from her mother, this book was Martineau's proclamation of independence.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>At the same time, Martineau turned the traditional patient/doctor relationship on its head by asserting control over her space even in sickness. The sickroom was her space. <i>Life in the Sickroom</i> explained how to regain control even in illness. Alarmed that a woman was suggesting such a position in the power dynamic, critics suggested that, as she was an invalid, her mind must also be sick and the work was not to be taken seriously. <i>British and Foreign Medical Review</i> dismissed Martineau's piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness. Instead, the <i>Review</i> recommended that patients follow "unconditional submission" to the advice of doctors.<sup id="cite_ref-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616_20-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616-20">[20]</a></sup> They disagreed with the idea that Martineau might hold any sort of "authority to Britain's invalids".<sup id="cite_ref-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616_20-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>Expecting to remain an invalid for the rest of her life, Martineau delighted in the new freedom of views using her <a href="/wiki/Telescope" title="Telescope">telescope</a>. Across the <a href="/wiki/River_Tyne" title="River Tyne">Tyne</a> was the sandy beach ″where there are frequent wrecks—too interesting to an invalid... and above the rocks, a spreading <a href="/wiki/Heath" title="Heath">heath</a>, where I watch troops of boys flying their kites; lovers and friends taking their breezy walks on Sundays..."<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> She expressed a lyrical view of Tynemouth:
</p>
<blockquote>When I look forth in the morning, the whole land may be sheeted with glistening snow, while the myrtle-green sea tumbles... there is none of the deadness of winter in the landscape; no leafless trees, no locking up with ice; and the air comes in through my open upper sash, but sun-warmed. The robins twitter and hop in my flower-boxes... and at night, what a heaven! What an expanse of stars above, appearing more steadfast, the more the Northern Lights dart and quiver!<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>During her illness, she for a second time declined a pension on the <a href="/wiki/Civil_list" title="Civil list">civil list</a>, fearing to compromise her political independence.

<p>In 1844 Martineau underwent a course of <a href="/wiki/Mesmerism" title="Mesmerism" class="mw-redirect">mesmerism</a>, returning to health after a few months. There was national interest in mesmerism at this time. Also known as 'animal magnetism', it can be defined as a "loosely grouped set of practices in which one person influenced another through a variety of personal actions, or through the direct influence of one mind on another mind.

Her work led to friction with "the natural prejudices of a surgeon and a surgeon's wife" (her brother-in-law and sister, <a href="/wiki/Martineau_family" title="Martineau family">Elizabeth Greenhow, née Martineau</a>).
</p><p>In 1845 she left <a href="/wiki/Tynemouth" title="Tynemouth">Tynemouth</a> for <a href="/wiki/Ambleside" title="Ambleside">Ambleside</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Lake_District" title="Lake District">Lake District</a>, where she built herself the house called <i>The Knoll, Ambleside</i>, where she spent the greater part of her later life.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> In 1845 she published three volumes of <i>Forest and Game Law Tales</i>.

On her return she published <i>Eastern Life, Present and Past</i> (1848).<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> This travelogue expressed her concept that, as humanity passed through one after another of the world's historic religions, the conception of the <a href="/wiki/Deity" title="Deity">deity</a> and of divine government became at each step more and more abstract and indefinite. She believed the ultimate goal to be philosophic <a href="/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheism</a>, but did not explicitly say so in the book.

Describing an <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> tomb, she wrote, "How like ours were his life and death!...

The book's "<a href="/wiki/Infidel" title="Infidel">infidel</a> tendency" was too much for the publisher <a href="/wiki/John_Murray_(publisher)" title="John Murray (publisher)">John Murray</a>, who rejected it.
</p><p>Martineau wrote <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Household_Education&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Household Education (page does not exist)">Household Education</a></i> in 1848, lamenting the state of women's education. She believed women had a natural inclination to motherhood and believed domestic work went hand in hand with academia for a proper, well-rounded education. She stated, "I go further than most persons... in desiring thorough practice in domestic occupations, from an early age, for young girls".<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> She proposed that freedom and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the most effectual instruments of education.
</p><p>Her interest in schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures, addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterward extended to their parents, at the request of the adults. The subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the <a href="/wiki/History_of_England" title="History of England">histories of England</a> and <a href="/wiki/History_of_North_America" title="History of North America">North America</a>, and the scenes of her Eastern travels. At the request of the publisher <a href="/wiki/Charles_Knight_(publisher)" title="Charles Knight (publisher)">Charles Knight</a>, in 1849 she wrote <i>The History of the Thirty Years' Peace, 1816–1846</i>, an excellent popular history from the point of view of a "philosophical Radical". Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time. She has been described as having an "essentially masculine nature".<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup> It was commonly thought that a "progressive" woman, in being progressive, was improperly emulating the qualities of a man.

<p>Martineau edited a volume of <i>Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development</i>, published in March 1851. Its epistolary form is based on correspondence between her and the self-styled scientist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Henry_G._Atkinson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Henry G. Atkinson (page does not exist)">Henry G. Atkinson</a>.  She expounded the doctrine of philosophical atheism, which she thought the tendency of human belief . She did not deny a <a href="/wiki/Cosmological_argument" title="Cosmological argument">first cause</a> but declared it <a href="/wiki/Agnosticism" title="Agnosticism">unknowable</a>.  She and Atkinson thought they affirmed man's <a href="/wiki/Moral_obligation" title="Moral obligation">moral obligation</a>. Atkinson was a zealous exponent of mesmerism. The prominence given to the topics of mesmerism and <a href="/wiki/Clairvoyance" title="Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a> heightened the general disapproval of the book.  Literary London was outraged by its mesmeric <a href="/wiki/Evolutionism" title="Evolutionism">evolutionary</a> atheism, and the book caused a lasting division between Martineau, her beloved brother, James who had become a Unitarian cleric, and some of her friends.
</p><p>From 1852 to 1866, she contributed regularly to the <i>Daily News</i>, writing sometimes six leaders a week. She wrote over 1600 articles for the paper in total.<sup id="cite_ref-spartacus-educational.com_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-spartacus-educational.com-5">[5]</a></sup>  It also published her <i>Letters from Ireland</i>, written during a visit to that country in the summer of 1852. For many years she was a contributor to the <i><a href="/wiki/Westminster_Review" title="Westminster Review">Westminster Review</a></i>; in 1854 she was among financial supporters who prevented its closing down.
</p><p>Martineau believed she was psychosomatic; this medical belief of the times related the uterus to emotions and hysteria. She had symptoms of hysteria in her loss of taste and smell.  Her partial deafness throughout life may have contributed to her problems. Various people, including the maid, her brother,<sup id="cite_ref-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616_20-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Winter_1995_597.E2.80.93616-20">[20]</a></sup> and Spencer T. Hall (a notable mesmerist) performed mesmerism on her.  Some historians attribute her apparent recovery from symptoms to a shift in the positioning of her tumor so that it no longer obstructed other organs. As the physical improvements were the first signs of healing she had in five years and happened at the same time of her first mesmeric treatment, Martineau confidentially credited mesmerism with her "cure".<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>She continued her political activism during the late 1850s and 1860s. She supported the Married Women's Property Bill and in 1856 signed a petition for it organised by Barbara Bodichon.  She also pushed for licensed prostitution and laws that addressed the customers rather than the women.  She supported women's <a href="/wiki/Suffrage" title="Suffrage">suffrage</a> and signed Bodichon's petition in its favour in 1866.
</p><p>In the early part of 1855, Martineau was suffering from <a href="/wiki/Heart_disease" title="Heart disease" class="mw-redirect">heart disease</a>. She began to write her autobiography, as she expected her life to end. Completing the book rapidly in three months, she postponed its publication until after her death, and lived another two decades.  It was published posthumously in 1877.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>When Darwin's book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Origin_of_Species" title="The Origin of Species" class="mw-redirect">The Origin of Species</a></i> was published in 1859, his brother Erasmus sent a copy to his old flame Harriet Martineau.  At age 58, she was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. From her "snow landscape", Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised
</p>
<blockquote>the quality &amp; conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness &amp; simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, &amp; the patient power by which it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentous knowledge. I should much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.</blockquote>Martineau supported Darwin's theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, "In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished."<sup id="cite_ref-bell_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bell-11">[11]</a></sup> She wrote to her fellow <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Malthus" title="Thomas Malthus" class="mw-redirect">Malthusian</a> (and atheist) <a href="/wiki/George_Holyoake" title="George Holyoake">George Holyoake</a> enthusing, "What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, &amp; Natural (as far as Final Causes &amp; Design are concerned) on the other.

<p>Harriet Martineau propounds political economic theories in <i>Illustrations of Political Economy</i>. She is seen as a frontrunner who merges fiction and economy in a time period when "fiction claimed authority over emotional knowledge, while economics claimed authority over empirical knowledge."<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> Moreover, Martineau's text sets the stage for women to enter into economics. For example, Dalley Lana explains that "by bringing the topic of domestic economy to bear on political economy, Martineau places women more centrally within economic theory and practice. In this context, women--as readers of the <i>Illustrations</i> and as characters with the tales--are not only rendered a part of larger-scale economics but also (because of their participation) encourage to learn the principles of political economy."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>As early as 1831, Martineau wrote on the subject "Political Economy" (as the field of economics was then known). Her goal was to popularise and illustrate the principles of <i><a href="/wiki/Laissez_faire" title="Laissez faire" class="mw-redirect">laissez faire</a></i> capitalism, though she made no claim to original theorising.
</p><p>Martineau's reflections on <i>Society in America</i>, published in 1837, are prime examples of her sociological methods. Her ideas in this field were set out in her 1838 book <i><a href="/wiki/How_to_Observe_Morals_and_Manners" title="How to Observe Morals and Manners">How to Observe Morals and Manners</a></i>. She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavour, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p><a href="/wiki/Auguste_Comte" title="Auguste Comte">Auguste Comte</a> coined the name sociology and published a rambling exposition under the title of <i>Cours de Philosophie Positive</i> in 1839.  Martineau undertook a translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as <i>The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau)</i>. It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.<sup id="cite_ref-Sociology_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sociology-26">[26]</a></sup>

<p>She left an autobiographical sketch to be published by the <i>Daily News</i>, in which she wrote:<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>Her original power was nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.</blockquote>
<p>In 1877 her autobiography was published. It was rare for a woman to publish such a work, let alone one secular in nature. Her book was regarded as dispassionate, "philosophic to the core" in its perceived masculinity, and a work of necessitarianism. She deeply explored childhood experiences and memories, expressing feelings of having been deprived of her mother's affection, as well as strong devotion to her brother <a href="/wiki/James_Martineau" title="James Martineau">James Martineau</a>, a theologian.<sup id="cite_ref-Postlethwaite_1989_2-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Postlethwaite_1989-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Anthony Giddens and Simon Griffiths argue that Martineau is a neglected founder of sociology and that she remains important today. She taught that study of the society must include all its aspects, including key political, religious and social institutions, and she insisted on the need to include the lives of women.  She was the first sociologist to study such issues as marriage, children, religious life, and race relations.  Finally, she called on sociologists to do more than just observe, but also work to benefit the society.<sup id="cite_ref-Sociology_26-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sociology-26">[26]</a></sup>
