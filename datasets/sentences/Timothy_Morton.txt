shelley scholarship 1995 morton published shelley revolution taste body natural world extension ideas presented doctoral dissertation
investigating how food came signify ideological outlook late eighteenth early nineteenth centuries morton's book attempt 'green' cultural criticism whereby bodies social environmental conditions appear shown interrelated
employing 'prescriptive' analysis various romantic texts especially percy bysshe shelley's vindication natural diet 1813 morton argues figurative rhetorical elements these texts should read simply clever language play commands establish consumptive practices challenge ideological configurations how body relates normativity
morton authoritarian power dynamics commodity flows industrial logic distinction domains nature culture inhered 'discourses diet' articulated shelleys
turn shelleyan prose regarding forms consumption particularly vegetarianism read call social reform figurative discussions intemperance intoxication warnings against tyranny

then 2006 morton edited cambridge companion shelley interdisciplinary overview percy bysshe shelley's themes language narrative structure literary philosophy political views
diet studies 2000 2004 morton published three works dealing intersection food cultural studies
first these published poetics spice romantic consumerism exotic 2000 morton unpacked evolution european consumer culture through analysis figurative use spice romantic literature
viewing spice cultural artifact functioned discourse object naively transparent itself during romantic period elucidates two general characteristics poetics spice materiality transumption
'materiality' spice connects symbolic social roles capacity desire production
morton cites trade winds topos perfumed breeze believed waft exotic lands spices domestic milton's paradise lost example concluding milton prefigures symbolic use spice later works presenting satan's journey hell chaos parallel travels spice traders
contrast 'transumption' following harold bloom's deployment rhetorical concept entails use metasignifier serves figure poetic language itself
according morton works john dryden exemplify transumption revealing novel kind capitalist poetics relying representation spice trade
spice balm object trade trope carried across boundaries standing money metaphor metaphor
carrying idea forward romantic era morton critiques manner spice became metaphor exotic desire subsequently encapsulated self-reflexivity modern processes commodification
later morton edited radical food culture politics eating drinking 1790-1820 2000 three-volume compendium eighteenth century texts examining literary sociocultural political history food including works intoxication cannibalism slavery
also edited cultures taste/theories appetite eating romanticism 2004 collection essays problematizes use taste appetite romantic metaphors bounded territories subjectivities while empirically interrogating organization romantic cultural economic structures around competing logics consumption
ecological theory since 2009 morton engaged sustained project ecological critique primarily enunciated two works ecology without nature 2007 ecological thought 2010 through problematizes environmental theory standpoint ecological entanglement
ecology without nature morton proposes ecological criticism must divested bifurcation nature civilization idea nature exists something sustains civilization exists outside society's walls
morton states ecological writing keeps insisting embedded nature
nature surrounding medium sustains our being
due properties rhetoric evokes idea surrounding medium ecological writing never properly establish nature thus provide compelling consistent aesthetic basis new worldview meant change society
small operation like tipping over domino
putting something called nature pedestal admiring afar does environment patriarchy does figure woman
paradoxical act sadistic admiration
viewing nature putative sense arbitrary textual signifier morton theorizes artistic representations environment sites opening ideas nature new possibilities
seeking aesthetic mode account differential paradoxical nonidentificational character environment proposes materialist method textual analysis called 'ambient poetics' artistic texts kinds considered terms how manage space appear thereby attuning sensibilities their audience forms natural representation contravene ideological coding nature transcendent principle
historicizing form poetics permits politicization environmental art 'ecomimesis' authenticating evocation author's environment such experience phenomena becomes present shared audience
art also important theme ecological thought prequel ecology without nature morton proposes concept 'dark ecology' means expressing irony ugliness horror ecology
vantage point dark ecology there exists no neutral theoretical ground articulate ecological claims
instead beings already implicated within ecological necessitating acknowledgement coexistential difference coping ecological catastrophe according morton already occurred
closely related dark ecology morton's concept 'mesh'
defining ecological thought thinking interconnectedness morton thus uses 'mesh' refer interconnectedness living non-living things consisting infinite connections infinitesimal differences
explains ecological thought does indeed consist ramifications truly wonderful fact mesh
life forms mesh dead ones their habitats also made up living nonliving beings
know even now how life forms shaped earth think oil oxygen—the first climate change cataclysm
drive around using crushed dinosaur parts
iron mostly by-product bacterial metabolism
mountains made shells fossilized bacteria
death mesh go together another sense too because natural selection implies extinction
mesh no central position privileges any form being over others thereby erases definitive interior exterior boundaries beings
emphasizing interdependence beings ecological thought permits no distance such beings relate each other totalizing open system negatively differentially rendering ambiguous those entities presume familiarity
morton calls these ambiguously inscribed beings 'strange strangers' beings unable completely comprehended labeled
within mesh even strangeness strange strangers relating coexistentially strange meaning know entity stranger becomes
intimacy then becomes threatening because veils mesh beneath illusion familiarity
object-oriented ontology morton became involved object-oriented ontology after ecological writings favorably compared movement's ideas
way work distinguished other variants object-oriented thought focus causal dimension object relations
against traditional causal philosophies morton argues causality aesthetic dimension relations objects wherein sensory experience does indicate direct access reality rather uncanny interruption false ontic equilibrium interobjective system
causation view held illusion-like magical forming core morton terms realist magic
hyperobjects ecological thought morton employed term hyperobjects describe objects massively distributed time space transcend spatiotemporal specificity such global warming styrofoam radioactive plutonium
subsequently enumerated five characteristics hyperobjects viscous hyperobjects adhere any other object touch no matter how hard object tries resist
way hyperobjects overrule ironic distance meaning object tries resist hyperobject glued hyperobject becomes
molten hyperobjects massive refute idea spacetime fixed concrete consistent
nonlocal hyperobjects massively distributed time space extent their totality cannot realized any particular local manifestation
example global warming hyperobject impacts meteorological conditions such tornado formation
according morton though objects don't feel global warming instead experience tornadoes cause damage specific places
thus nonlocality describes manner hyperobject becomes substantial local manifestations produce
phased hyperobjects occupy higher-dimensional space other entities normally perceive
thus hyperobjects appear come go three-dimensional space appear differently observer higher multidimensional view
interobjective hyperobjects formed relations object
consequently objects able perceive imprint footprint hyperobject upon other objects revealed information
example global warming formed interactions sun fossil fuels carbon dioxide among other objects
yet global warming made apparent through emissions levels temperature changes ocean levels making seem global warming product scientific models rather object predated own measurement
according morton hyperobjects become visible during age ecological crisis alert humans ecological dilemmas defining age live
additionally existential capacity hyperobjects outlast turn toward less materialistic cultural values coupled threat many such objects pose toward organic matter morton calls demonic inversion sacred substances religion gives them potential spiritual quality their treatment future societies may become indistinguishable reverential care
