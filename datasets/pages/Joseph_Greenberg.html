<p><i>(Main source: Croft 2003)</i>
</p><p>Joseph Greenberg was born on May 28, 1915 to <a href="/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish" class="mw-redirect">Jewish</a> parents in <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York" title="Brooklyn, New York" class="mw-redirect">Brooklyn, New York</a>. His first love was music. At the age of 14, he gave a piano concert at Steinway Hall. He continued to play the piano daily throughout his life.
</p><p>After finishing high school, he decided to pursue a scholarly career rather than a musical one. He enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> in New York. In his senior year, he attended a class taught by <a href="/wiki/Franz_Boas" title="Franz Boas">Franz Boas</a> on <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous languages of the Americas">American Indian languages</a>. With references from Boas and <a href="/wiki/Ruth_Benedict" title="Ruth Benedict">Ruth Benedict</a>, he was accepted as a graduate student by <a href="/wiki/Melville_J._Herskovits" title="Melville J. Herskovits">Melville J. Herskovits</a> at <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a> in Chicago. In the course of his graduate studies, Greenberg did fieldwork among the <a href="/wiki/Hausa_people" title="Hausa people">Hausa</a> of Nigeria, where he learned the <a href="/wiki/Hausa_language" title="Hausa language">Hausa language</a>. The subject of his doctoral dissertation was the influence of <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a> on a Hausa group that, unlike most others, had not converted to it.
</p><p>In 1940, he began postdoctoral studies at <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>. These were interrupted by service in the <a href="/wiki/Signal_Corps_(United_States_Army)" title="Signal Corps (United States Army)">U.S. Army Signal Corps</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, where he worked as a <a href="/wiki/Cryptanalysis" title="Cryptanalysis">codebreaker</a> and participated in the <a href="/wiki/Operation_Torch#Battle" title="Operation Torch">landing at Casablanca</a>. Before leaving for Europe in 1943, Greenberg married Selma Berkowitz, whom he had met during his first year at Columbia.

<p>After the war, Greenberg taught at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Minnesota" title="University of Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> before returning to Columbia University in 1948 as a teacher of <a href="/wiki/Cultural_anthropology" title="Cultural anthropology">anthropology</a>.

They introduced him to the <a href="/wiki/Prague_Linguistic_Circle" title="Prague Linguistic Circle" class="mw-redirect">Prague school</a> of <a href="/wiki/Structuralism" title="Structuralism">structuralism</a>, which influenced his work.
</p><p>In 1962, Greenberg moved to the anthropology department of <a href="/wiki/Stanford_University" title="Stanford University">Stanford University</a> in California, where he continued to work for the rest of his life. In 1965 Greenberg served as president of the <a href="/wiki/African_Studies_Association" title="African Studies Association">African Studies Association</a>.

<p>Greenberg's reputation rests in part on his contributions to <a href="/wiki/Synchronic_linguistics" title="Synchronic linguistics" class="mw-redirect">synchronic linguistics</a> and the quest to identify <a href="/wiki/Greenberg%27s_linguistic_universals" title="Greenberg's linguistic universals">linguistic universals</a>. In the late 1950s, Greenberg began to examine corpora of languages covering a wide geographic and genetic distribution. He located a number of interesting potential universals as well as many strong cross-linguistic tendencies.
</p><p>In particular, Greenberg conceptualized the idea of <a href="/wiki/Linguistic_universal" title="Linguistic universal">"implicational universal"</a>, which takes the form, "if a language has structure X, then it must also have structure Y." For example, X might be "mid front rounded vowels" and Y "high front rounded vowels" (for terminology see <a href="/wiki/Phonetics" title="Phonetics">phonetics</a>). Many scholars took up this kind of research following Greenberg's example and it remains important in synchronic linguistics.
</p><p>Like <a href="/wiki/Noam_Chomsky" title="Noam Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, Greenberg sought to discover the universal structures underlying human language. Unlike Chomsky, Greenberg’s approach was <a href="/wiki/Functionalist_theories_of_grammar" title="Functionalist theories of grammar" class="mw-redirect">functionalist</a>, rather than <a href="/wiki/Formal_language_theory" title="Formal language theory" class="mw-redirect">formalist</a>. An argument to reconcile the Greenbergian and Chomskyan approaches can be found in <i>Linguistic Universals</i> (2006), edited by Ricardo Mairal and Juana Gil .
</p><p>Many who are strongly opposed to Greenberg's methods of language classification (see below) acknowledge the importance of his typological work. In 1963 he published an article that was extremely influential in the field: "Some universals of grammar with particular reference to the order of meaningful elements".

<div role="note" class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/Mass_comparison" title="Mass comparison">Mass comparison</a></div>
<p>Greenberg rejected the view, prevalent among linguists since the mid-20th century, that <a href="/wiki/Comparative_method" title="Comparative method" class="mw-redirect">comparative reconstruction</a> was the only tool to discover relationships between languages. He argued that genetic classification is methodologically prior to comparative reconstruction, or the first stage of it: you cannot engage in the comparative reconstruction of languages until you know which languages to compare (1957:44).
</p><p>He also criticized the prevalent view that comprehensive comparisons of two languages at a time (which commonly take years to carry out) could establish language families of any size. He argued that, even for 8 languages, there are already 4,140 ways to classify them into distinct families, while for 25 languages there are 4,749,027,089,305,918,018 ways (1957:44). By way of comparison, the <a href="/wiki/Niger%E2%80%93Congo_languages" title="Niger–Congo languages">Niger–Congo</a> family is said to have some 1,500 languages. He thought language families of any size needed to be established by some scholastic means other than bilateral comparison. The theory of mass comparison is an attempt to demonstrate what those means are.
</p><p>Greenberg argued for the virtues of breadth over depth. He advocated restricting the amount of material to be compared (to basic vocabulary, morphology, and known paths of sound change) and increasing the number of languages to be compared to all the languages in a given area. This would make it possible to compare numerous languages reliably. At the same time, the process would provide a check on accidental resemblances through the sheer number of languages under review. The mathematical probability that resemblances are accidental decreases sharply with the number of languages concerned (1957:39).
</p><p>Greenberg claimed that mass "borrowing" of basic vocabulary is unknown. He argued that borrowing, when it occurs, is concentrated in cultural vocabulary and clusters "in certain semantic areas", making it easy to detect (1957:39). With a goal of determining broad patterns of relationship, the issue was not to get every word right but to detect patterns. From the beginning with his theory of mass comparison, Greenberg addressed why the issues of chance resemblance and borrowing were not obstacles to its being useful. Despite that, critics consider those areas were shortcomings of the theory.
</p><p>Greenberg first called this method "mass comparison" in an article in 1954 (reprinted in Greenberg 1955). As of 1987, he replaced the term "mass comparison" with "multilateral comparison", to emphasize its contrast with the bilateral comparisons recommended in linguistics textbooks. He believed that multilateral comparison was not in any way opposed to the comparative method, but is, on the contrary, its necessary first step (Greenberg, 1957:44). According to him, comparative reconstruction should have the status of an explanatory theory for facts already established by language classification (Greenberg, 1957:45).
</p><p>Most historical linguists (Campbell 2001:45) reject the use of mass comparison as a tool for establishing genealogical relationships between languages. Among the most outspoken critics of mass comparison have been <a href="/wiki/Lyle_Campbell" title="Lyle Campbell">Lyle Campbell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Donald_Ringe" title="Donald Ringe">Donald Ringe</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Poser" title="William Poser">William Poser</a>, and the late <a href="/wiki/Larry_Trask" title="Larry Trask">R.

<div role="note" class="hatnote relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="/wiki/The_Languages_of_Africa" title="The Languages of Africa">The Languages of Africa</a></div>
<p>Greenberg is widely known for his development of a classification system for the <a href="/wiki/Languages_of_Africa" title="Languages of Africa">languages of Africa</a>, which he published as a series of articles in the <i>Southwestern Journal of Anthropology</i> from 1949 to 1954 (reprinted together as a book in 1955). He revised the book and published it again in 1963, followed by a nearly identical edition in 1966 (reprinted without change in 1970). A few further changes to the classification were made by Greenberg in an article in 1981.
</p><p>Greenberg grouped the hundreds of African languages into four families, which he dubbed <a href="/wiki/Afro-Asiatic_languages" title="Afro-Asiatic languages" class="mw-redirect">Afroasiatic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Nilo-Saharan_languages" title="Nilo-Saharan languages">Nilo-Saharan</a>, <a href="/wiki/Niger%E2%80%93Congo_languages" title="Niger–Congo languages">Niger–Congo</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Khoisan_languages" title="Khoisan languages">Khoisan</a>. In the course of his work, Greenberg coined the term "Afroasiatic" to replace the earlier term "Hamito-Semitic", after showing that racially based <a href="/wiki/Hamitic" title="Hamitic">Hamitic</a>, widely accepted since the 19th century, is not a valid language family. Another major feature of his work was to support the classification of the <a href="/wiki/Bantu_languages" title="Bantu languages">Bantu languages</a>, which occupy much of <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, as a branch of the <a href="/wiki/Niger%E2%80%93Congo_language" title="Niger–Congo language" class="mw-redirect">Niger–Congo language</a> family, rather than as an independent family as many Bantuists had maintained.
</p><p>Greenberg's classification rested largely in evaluating competing earlier classifications. For a time, his classification was considered bold and speculative, especially the proposal of a Nilo-Saharan languages family. Now, apart from Khoisan, it is generally accepted by African specialists and has been used as a basis for further work by other scholars.
</p><p>Greenberg's work on African languages has been criticised by <a href="/wiki/Lyle_Campbell" title="Lyle Campbell">Lyle Campbell</a> and Donald Ringe, who do not believe that his classification is justified by his data; they request a reexamination of his macro-phyla by "reliable methods" (Ringe 1993:104). <a href="/wiki/Harold_C._Fleming" title="Harold C. Fleming">Harold Fleming</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lionel_Bender_(linguist)" title="Lionel Bender (linguist)">Lionel Bender</a>, who are sympathetic to Greenberg's classification, acknowledge that at least some of his macrofamilies (particularly Nilo-Saharan and Khoisan) are not fully accepted by the linguistic community and may need to be split up (Campbell 1997). Their objection is <a href="/wiki/Methodology" title="Methodology">methodological</a>: if mass comparison is not a valid method, it cannot be expected to successfully have brought order out of the chaos of African languages.
</p><p>In contrast, some linguists have sought to combine Greenberg's four African families into larger units. In particular, Edgar Gregersen (1972) proposed joining Niger–Congo and Nilo-Saharan into a larger family, which he termed <a href="/wiki/Niger%E2%80%93Congo_languages#Niger.E2.80.93Congo_and_Nilo-Saharan" title="Niger–Congo languages">Kongo-Saharan</a>. <a href="/wiki/Roger_Blench" title="Roger Blench">Roger Blench</a> (1995) suggests Niger–Congo is a subfamily of Nilo-Saharan.

<p>In 1971 Greenberg proposed the <a href="/wiki/Indo-Pacific_languages" title="Indo-Pacific languages">Indo-Pacific</a> <a href="/wiki/Macrofamily" title="Macrofamily">macrofamily</a>, which groups together the <a href="/wiki/Papuan_languages" title="Papuan languages">Papuan languages</a> (a large number of language families of <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> and nearby islands) with the native languages of the <a href="/wiki/Andaman_Islands" title="Andaman Islands">Andaman Islands</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> but excludes the <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_Australian_languages" title="Indigenous Australian languages" class="mw-redirect">Australian Aboriginal languages</a>. Its principal feature was to reduce the manifold language families of New Guinea to a single genetic unit. This excludes the <a href="/wiki/Austronesian_languages" title="Austronesian languages">Austronesian languages</a>, which have been established as associated with a more recent migration of peoples.
</p><p>Greenberg's <a href="/wiki/Subgrouping_(linguistics)" title="Subgrouping (linguistics)" class="mw-redirect">subgrouping</a> of these languages has not been accepted by the few specialists who have worked on the classification of these languages. However, the work of <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Wurm" title="Stephen Wurm">Stephen Wurm</a> (1982) and <a href="/wiki/Malcolm_Ross_(linguist)" title="Malcolm Ross (linguist)">Malcolm Ross</a> (2005) has provided considerable support for his once-radical idea that these languages form a single genetic unit. Wurm stated that the lexical similarities between Great Andamanese and the West Papuan and Timor–Alor families "are quite striking and amount to virtual formal identity [...] in a number of instances." He believes this to be due to a linguistic <a href="/wiki/Substratum" title="Substratum" class="mw-redirect">substratum</a>.

<p>Most <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">American Indian</a> linguists classify the <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas" title="Indigenous languages of the Americas">native languages of the Americas</a> into 150 to 180 independent language families. Some have thought two language families, <a href="/wiki/Eskimo%E2%80%93Aleut" title="Eskimo–Aleut" class="mw-redirect">Eskimo–Aleut</a> and <a href="/wiki/Na-Den%C3%A9" title="Na-Dené" class="mw-redirect">Na-Dené</a>, were distinct, perhaps the results of later migrations into the New World.
</p><p>Early on, Greenberg (1957:41, 1960) became convinced that many of the language groups considered unrelated could be classified into larger groupings. In his 1987 book <i>Language in the Americas</i>, while supporting the <a href="/wiki/Eskimo%E2%80%93Aleut" title="Eskimo–Aleut" class="mw-redirect">Eskimo–Aleut</a> and <a href="/wiki/Na-Den%C3%A9" title="Na-Dené" class="mw-redirect">Na-Dené</a> groupings as distinct, he proposed that all the other Native American languages belong to a single language macro-family, which he termed <a href="/wiki/Amerind_languages" title="Amerind languages">Amerind</a>.
</p><p><i>Language in the Americas</i> has generated lively debate, but has been strongly criticized; it is rejected by most specialists in indigenous languages of the Americas and also by most historical linguists. Specialists in the individual language families have found extensive inaccuracies and errors in Greenberg’s data, such as including data from non-existent languages, erroneous transcriptions of the forms compared, misinterpretations of the meanings of words used for comparison, and entirely spurious forms.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Historical linguists also reject the validity of the method of multilateral (or mass) comparison upon which the classification is based. They argue that he has not provided a convincing case that the similarities presented as evidence are due to inheritance from an earlier common ancestor rather than being explained by a combination of accidental similarity, errors, excessive semantic latitude in comparisons, borrowings, onomatopoeia, etc.

<dl><dd> <i>Main article: <a href="/wiki/Eurasiatic_languages" title="Eurasiatic languages">Eurasiatic languages</a></i></dd></dl>
<p>Later in his life, Greenberg proposed that nearly all of the language families of northern <a href="/wiki/Eurasia" title="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> belong to a single higher-order family, which he called <a href="/wiki/Eurasiatic_languages" title="Eurasiatic languages">Eurasiatic</a>. The only exception was <a href="/wiki/Yeniseian_languages" title="Yeniseian languages">Yeniseian</a>, which has been related to a wider <a href="/wiki/Den%C3%A9%E2%80%93Caucasian" title="Dené–Caucasian" class="mw-redirect">Dené–Caucasian</a> grouping, also including <a href="/wiki/Sino-Tibetan" title="Sino-Tibetan" class="mw-redirect">Sino-Tibetan</a>.  In 2008 <a href="/wiki/Edward_Vajda" title="Edward Vajda">Edward Vajda</a> related Yeniseian to the <a href="/wiki/Na-Dene_languages" title="Na-Dene languages">Na-Dené</a> languages of North America in a <a href="/wiki/Den%C3%A9%E2%80%93Yeniseian" title="Dené–Yeniseian" class="mw-redirect">Dené–Yeniseian</a> family.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Eurasiatic grouping resembles the older <a href="/wiki/Nostratic_languages" title="Nostratic languages">Nostratic</a> groupings of <a href="/wiki/Holger_Pedersen_(linguist)" title="Holger Pedersen (linguist)">Holger Pedersen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vladislav_Illich-Svitych" title="Vladislav Illich-Svitych">Vladislav Illich-Svitych</a> by including <a href="/wiki/Indo-European_languages" title="Indo-European languages">Indo-European</a>, <a href="/wiki/Uralic_languages" title="Uralic languages">Uralic</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Altaic_languages" title="Altaic languages">Altaic</a>. It differs by including <a href="/wiki/Nivkh_language" title="Nivkh language">Nivkh</a>, <a href="/wiki/Classification_of_Japanese" title="Classification of Japanese" class="mw-redirect">Japonic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Korean_language" title="Korean language">Korean</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Ainu_language" title="Ainu language">Ainu</a> (which the Nostraticists had excluded from comparison because they are single languages rather than language families) and in excluding <a href="/wiki/Afroasiatic_languages" title="Afroasiatic languages">Afroasiatic</a>. At about this time, Russian Nostraticists, notably <a href="/wiki/Sergei_Starostin" title="Sergei Starostin">Sergei Starostin</a>, constructed a revised version of Nostratic. It was slightly broader than Greenberg's grouping but it also left out Afroasiatic.
</p><p>Recently, a consensus has been emerging among proponents of the Nostratic hypothesis. Greenberg basically agreed with the Nostratic concept, though he stressed a deep internal division between its northern 'tier' (his Eurasiatic) and a southern 'tier' (principally Afroasiatic and Dravidian).
</p><p>The American Nostraticist <a href="/wiki/Allan_R._Bomhard" title="Allan R. Bomhard">Allan Bomhard</a> considers Eurasiatic a branch of Nostratic, alongside other branches: Afroasiatic, <a href="/wiki/Elamo-Dravidian_languages" title="Elamo-Dravidian languages">Elamo-Dravidian</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Kartvelian_languages" title="Kartvelian languages">Kartvelian</a>. Similarly, <a href="/wiki/Georgiy_Starostin" title="Georgiy Starostin">Georgiy Starostin</a> (2002) arrives at a tripartite overall grouping: he considers Afroasiatic, Nostratic and Elamite to be roughly equidistant and more closely related to each other than to anything else.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> Sergei Starostin's school has now included Afroasiatic in a broadly defined Nostratic. They reserve the term Eurasiatic to designate the narrower subgrouping, which comprises the rest of the macrofamily. Recent proposals thus differ mainly on the precise placement of Dravidian and Kartvelian.
</p><p>Greenberg continued to work on this project after he was diagnosed with incurable pancreatic cancer until he died in May 2001. His colleague and former student <a href="/wiki/Merritt_Ruhlen" title="Merritt Ruhlen">Merritt Ruhlen</a> ensured the publication of the final volume of his Eurasiatic work (2002) after his death.
