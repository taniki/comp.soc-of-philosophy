<p>Charles Hodge's father, Hugh, was the son of a <a href="/wiki/Scotsman" title="Scotsman" class="mw-redirect">Scotsman</a> who emigrated from <a href="/wiki/Northern_Ireland" title="Northern Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> early in the eighteenth century. Hugh graduated from <a href="/wiki/Princeton_College" title="Princeton College" class="mw-redirect">Princeton College</a> in 1773 and served as a military surgeon in the <a href="/wiki/Revolutionary_War" title="Revolutionary War" class="mw-redirect">Revolutionary War</a>, after which he practiced medicine in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. He married well-born Bostonian orphan Mary Blanchard in 1790. The Hodge's first three sons died in the <a href="/wiki/Yellow_Fever_Epidemic_of_1793" title="Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793" class="mw-redirect">Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793</a> and another <a href="/wiki/Yellow_fever" title="Yellow fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic in 1795. Their first son to survive childhood, Hugh Lenox, was born in 1796. Hugh Lenox would become an authority in <a href="/wiki/Obstretics" title="Obstretics" class="mw-redirect">obstretics</a>, and he would remain especially close with Charles, often assisting him financially. Charles was born on December 27, 1797. His father died seven months later of complications from the yellow fever he had contracted in the epidemic of 1795. They were brought up by relatives, many of whom were wealthy and influential. Mary Hodge made sacrifices and took in boarders in order to put the boys through school. She, with the help of the family's minister <a href="/wiki/Ashbel_Green" title="Ashbel Green">Ashbel Green</a>, also provided the customary <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian" class="mw-redirect">Presbyterian</a> religious education using the <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Shorter_Catechism" title="Westminster Shorter Catechism">Westminster Shorter Catechism</a>.

<p>At Princeton, the first president of the new seminary, <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Alexander" title="Archibald Alexander">Archibald Alexander</a>, took a special interest in Hodge, assisting him in Greek and taking him with him on itinerant preaching trips. Hodge would name <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Alexander_Hodge" title="Archibald Alexander Hodge">his first son</a> after Alexander.

In 1815, during a time of intense religious fervor among the students encouraged by Green and Alexander, Hodge joined the local Presbyterian church and decided to enter the ministry. Shortly after completing his undergraduate studies he entered the seminary in 1816. The course of study was very rigorous, requiring students to recite scripture in the original languages and to use the dogmatics written in Latin in the 17th-century by <a href="/wiki/Reformed_scholastic" title="Reformed scholastic" class="mw-redirect">Reformed scholastic</a> <a href="/wiki/Francis_Turretin" title="Francis Turretin">Francis Turretin</a> as a theological textbook.

</p><p>Following graduation from Princeton Seminary in 1819, Hodge received additional instruction privately from Hebrew scholar Rev. Joseph Bates in Philadelphia.

<p>Starting in the 1830s Hodge suffered from an immobilizing pain in his leg, and was forced to conduct his classes from his study from 1833–1836. He continued to write articles for <i>Biblical Repertory</i>, now renamed the <i>Princeton Review</i>. During the 1830s he wrote a major <a href="/wiki/Biblical_commentary" title="Biblical commentary" class="mw-redirect">commentary</a> on <a href="/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Romans" title="Epistle to the Romans">Romans</a> and a history of the Presbyterian church in America.

<p>Hodge wrote many biblical and theological works.  He began writing early in his theological career and continued publishing until his death. In 1835 he published his <i>Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans</i>, which is considered to be his greatest exegetical work. Other works followed at intervals of longer or shorter duration - <i>Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States</i> (1840); <i>Way of Life</i> (1841, republished in England, translated into other languages, and circulated to the extent of 35,000 copies in America); <i>Commentary on Ephesians</i> (1856); <i>on First Corinthians</i> (1857); <i>on Second Corinthians</i> (1859). His <i>magnum opus</i> is the <i>Systematic Theology</i> (1871–1873), of 3 volumes and extending to 2,260 pages. His last book, <i>What is Darwinism?</i> appeared in 1874. In addition to all this it must be remembered that he contributed upward of 130 articles to the <i>Princeton Review</i>, many of which, besides exerting a powerful influence at the time of their publication, have since been gathered into volumes, and as Selection of <i>Essays and Reviews from the Princeton Review</i> (1857) and <i>Discussions in Church Polity</i> (ed. W. Durant, 1878) have taken a permanent place in theological literature.
</p><p>This record of Hodge's literary life is suggestive of the great influence that he exerted. But properly to estimate that influence, it must be remembered that 3,000 ministers of the Gospel passed under his instruction, and that to him was accorded the rare privilege, during the course of a long life, of achieving distinction as a teacher, exegete, preacher, controversialist, ecclesiastic, and <a href="/wiki/Systematic_theology" title="Systematic theology">systematic theologian</a>. As a teacher he had few equals; and if he did not display popular gifts in the pulpit, he revealed homiletical powers of a high order in the "conferences" on <a href="/wiki/Sabbath_in_Christianity" title="Sabbath in Christianity">Sabbath</a> afternoons, where he spoke with his accustomed clearness and logical precision, but with great spontaneity and amazing tenderness and unction.
</p><p>Hodge's literary powers were seen at their best in his contributions to the <i><a href="/wiki/Princeton_Theological_Review" title="Princeton Theological Review" class="mw-redirect">Princeton Theological Review</a></i>, many of which are acknowledged masterpieces of controversial writing. They cover a wide range of topics, from <a href="/wiki/Apologetics" title="Apologetics">apologetic</a> questions that concern common Christianity to questions of ecclesiastical administration, in which only <a href="/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian" class="mw-redirect">Presbyterians</a> have been supposed to take interest. But the questions in debate among American theologians during the period covered by Hodge's life belonged, for the most part, to the departments of anthropology and <a href="/wiki/Soteriology" title="Soteriology">soteriology</a>; and it was upon these, accordingly, that his polemic powers were mainly applied.
</p><p>All of the books that he authored have remained in print over a century after his death.

<p>Devotion to Christ was the salient characteristic of his experience, and it was the test by which he judged the experience of others. Hence, though a Presbyterian and a Calvinist, his sympathies went far beyond the boundaries of sect. He refused to entertain the narrow views of church polity which some of his brethren advocated. He repudiated the unhistorical position of those who denied the validity of Roman Catholic baptism.

<p>He was conservative by nature, and his life was spent in defending the Reformed theology as set forth in the <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith" title="Westminster Confession of Faith">Westminster Confession of Faith</a> and <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Larger_Catechism" title="Westminster Larger Catechism">Larger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Shorter_Catechism" title="Westminster Shorter Catechism">Westminster Shorter Catechisms</a>. He was fond of saying that Princeton had never originated a new idea; but this meant no more than that Princeton was the advocate of historical Calvinism in opposition to the modified and provincial Calvinism of a later day. And it is true that Hodge must be classed among the great defenders of the faith, rather than among the great constructive minds of the Church. He had no ambition to be epoch-making by marking the era of a new departure. But he earned a higher title to fame in that he was the champion of his Church's faith during a long and active life, her trusted leader in time of trial, and for more than half a century the most conspicuous teacher of her ministry. Hodges' understanding of the Christian faith and of historical Protestantism is given in his <i>Systematic Theology.</i>

<p>As an archconservative and a believer in both the inerrancy and the literal interpretation of the Bible, Hodge supported the institution of <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a> in its most abstract sense, as having support from certain passages in the Bible. He held slaves himself, but he condemned their mistreatment, and made a distinction between slavery in the abstract and what he saw as the unjust Southern Slave Laws that deprived slaves of their right to educational instruction, to marital and parental rights, and that "subject them to the insults and oppression of the whites." It was his opinion that the humanitarian reform of these laws would become the necessary prelude to the eventual end of slavery in the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-Torbett_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Torbett-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Presbyterian General Assembly of 1818 had affirmed a similar position, that slavery within the United States, while not necessarily sinful, was a regrettable institution that ought to eventually be changed.<sup id="cite_ref-Torbett_10-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Torbett-10">[10]</a></sup> Like the church, Hodge himself had sympathies with both the <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">abolitionists</a> in the North and the pro-slavery advocates in the South, and he used his considerable influence in an attempt to restore order and find common ground between the two factions, with the eventual hope of abolishing slavery altogether.
</p><p>Hodge's support of slavery was not an inevitable result of his belief in the inerrancy and the literal interpretation of the Bible. Other 19th century Christian contemporaries of Hodge, who also believed in the inerrancy and infallibility of the Bible, denounced the institution of slavery. <a href="/wiki/John_Williamson_Nevin" title="John Williamson Nevin">John Williamson Nevin</a>, a conservative, evangelical Reformed scholar and seminary professor, denounced slavery as 'a vast moral evil.'<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Hodge and Nevin also famously clashed over polar-opposite views of the Lord's Supper.

<p>Hodge was a leader of the Old School faction of Presbyterians during the division of the Presbyterian Church (USA) in 1837. The issues involved conflicts over doctrine, religious practice, and slavery. Although prior to 1861 the Old School refrained from denouncing slavery, the issue was a matter of debate between Northern and Southern components of the denomination.

<p>Hodge could tolerate slavery but he could never tolerate treason of the sort he saw trying to break up the United States in 1861. Hodge was a strong nationalist and led the fight among Presbyterians to support the Union.  In the January 1861 <i>Princeton Review</i>, Hodge laid out his case against secession, in the end calling it unconstitutional. <a href="/wiki/James_Henley_Thornwell" title="James Henley Thornwell">James Henley Thornwell</a> responded in the January 1861 <i>Southern Presbyterian Journal,</i> holding that the election of 1860 had installed a new government, one which the South did not agree with, thus making secession lawful.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>  Despite being a staunch Unionist politically, Hodge voted against the support for the "Spring Resolutions" of the 1861 General Assembly of the Old School Presbyterian Church, thinking it was not the business of the church to involve itself in political matters; because of the resolutions, the denomination then split North and South. When the General Assembly convened in Philadelphia in May 1861, one month after the Civil War began, the resolution stipulated pledging support for the federal government over objections based on concerns about the scope of church jurisdiction and disagreements about its interpretation of the Constitution. In December 1861, the Southern Old School Presbyterian churches severed ties with the denomination.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>In 1874, Hodge published <i>What is Darwinism?</i>, claiming that <a href="/wiki/Darwinism" title="Darwinism">Darwinism</a>, was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, Darwinism was contrary to the notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Both in the <i>Review</i> and in <i>What is Darwinism?,</i> (1874) Hodge attacked Darwinism. His views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile at the college across town (a totally separate institution) President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However in 1868, upon Maclean's retirement, <a href="/wiki/James_McCosh" title="James McCosh">James McCosh</a>, a philosopher, became president. McCosh believed that much of Darwinism could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus argued that Darwinism was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college (<a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>The debate between Hodge and McCosh exemplified an emerging conflict between science and religion over the question of Darwin's evolution theory. However, the two men showed greater similarities regarding matters of science and religion than popularly appreciated. Both supported the increasing role of scientific inquiry in natural history and resisted its intrusion into philosophy and religion.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
