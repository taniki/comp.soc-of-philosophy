He worked in printing and publishing prior to entering the <a href="/wiki/Society_of_Jesus" title="Society of Jesus">Society of Jesus</a> in 1935, and was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1946.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary_of_Ong.27s_works_and_interests">Summary of Ong's works and interests</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Walter_J._Ong&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Summary of Ong's works and interests">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>A major concern of Ong's works is the impact that the shift from orality to literacy has had on culture and education. Writing is a technology like other technologies (fire, the steam engine, etc.) that, when introduced to a "primary oral culture" (which has never known writing) has extremely wide-ranging impacts in all areas of life. These include culture, economics, politics, art, and more. Furthermore, even a small amount of education in writing transforms people's mentality from the holistic immersion of orality to interiorization and individuation. 
</p><p>Many of the effects of the introduction of the technology of writing are related to the fact that oral cultures require strategies of preserving information in the absence of writing. These include, for example, a reliance on proverbs or condensed wisdom for making decisions, epic poetry, and stylized culture heroes (wise Nestor, crafty Odysseus). Writing makes these features no longer necessary, and introduces new strategies of remembering cultural material, which itself now changes.
</p><p>Because cultures at any given time vary along a continuum between full orality and full literacy, Ong distinguishes between primary oral cultures (which have never known writing), cultures with craft literacy (such as scribes), and cultures in a transition phase from orality to literacy, in which some people know of writing but are illiterate - these cultures have "residual orality".
</p><p>Some of Ong's interests:
</p>
<ol><li> the historical development of visualist tendencies in Western philosophic thought</li>
<li> the mathematical transformation of thought in medieval and early modern logic and beyond</li>
<li> oral cyclic thought, which is characteristic of primary oral cultures, versus linear or historical or evolutionary thought, which depends on writing</li>
<li> the movement from oral heroic poetry to mock-heroic poetry in <a href="/wiki/Print_culture" title="Print culture">print culture</a> to the realist tradition in literature to the modern antihero</li>
<li> the historical development in manuscript culture and <a href="/wiki/Print_culture" title="Print culture">print culture</a> of the inward turn of personalized ego-consciousness, or individuality</li>
<li> the new dimensions of <a href="/wiki/Orality" title="Orality">orality</a> fostered by modern communication media that accentuate sound, which Ong calls <a href="/wiki/Secondary_orality" title="Secondary orality">secondary orality</a> as it succeeds from, relies on, and coexists with writing</li>
<li> the origins and development of the Western educational system</li>
<li> the role and effects of <a href="/wiki/Medieval_Latin" title="Medieval Latin">Learned Latin</a> in Western culture</li></ol>

<p>According to Adrian Johns' foreword to the 2004 edition, Ong was urged to research Ramus after his graduate mentor, <a href="/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> had no particular interest in Ong's original subject, Gerard Manley Hopkins. McLuhan vigorously encouraged Ong's work, and eventually drew upon his former student's perspective on Ramism to write his own pivotal work, ‘<a href="/wiki/The_Gutenberg_Galaxy" title="The Gutenberg Galaxy">The Gutenberg Galaxy</a>.’ <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p><i>Ramus, Method, and the Decay of Dialogue: From the Art of Discourse to the Art of Reason</i> (1958) elaborates the contrast between the visual and the oral that Ong found in Louis Lavelle's <i>La parole et l'ecriture</i> (1942). Ong details how the spatialization and quantification of thought in dialectic and logic during the Middle Ages enabled "a new state of mind" to emerge in <a href="/wiki/Print_culture" title="Print culture">print culture</a>, which is associated with the emergence of modern science.
</p><p>The companion volume, <i>Ramus and Talon Inventory</i> (1958) is a notable work that contributes to the field known today as book history. Therein, Ong briefly describes more than 750 volumes (mostly in Latin) that he had tracked down in more than 100 libraries in Europe.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Petrus_Ramus" title="Petrus Ramus">Peter Ramus</a> (1515-1572), was a French humanist, logician, and educational reformer whose <a href="/wiki/Ramism" title="Ramism">textbook method of analyzing subjects</a> was very widely adopted in many academic fields.  In "Ramist Classroom Procedure and the Nature of Reality" (Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900, Vol. 1, No. 1, The English Renaissance (Winter, 1961), pp.&#160;31–47), Ong discusses Ramism as a transition phase between the Classical style of education and the modern one. He writes, "...Ramism might seem merely quaint, perhaps artistically lethal, but of no great importance. Yet its great spread will hardly allow us to regard it as educationally insignificant. As a matter of fact, it has educational significance of the headiest sort, for it implies no less than that it is the "arts" or curriculum subjects which hold the world together. Nothing is accessible for "use," that is, for active intussusception by the human being, until it has first been put through the curriculum. The schoolroom is by implication the doorway to reality, and indeed the only doorway." (p. 47)

</p><p>He writes,  "[my] works do not maintain that the evolution from primary orality through writing and print to an electronic culture, which produces secondary orality, causes or explains everything in human culture and consciousness. Rather, [my] thesis is relationist: major developments, and very likely even all major developments, in culture and consciousness, are related, often in unexpected intimacy, to the evolution of the word from primary orality to its present state. But the relationships are varied and complex, with cause and effect often difficult to distinguish" (<i>Interfaces of the Word</i>, 1977: 9-10).

<p>In Ong's most widely known work, <i>Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word</i> (1982), he attempts to identify the distinguishing characteristics of <a href="/wiki/Orality" title="Orality">orality</a> by examining <a href="/wiki/Thought" title="Thought">thought</a> and its verbal expression in societies where the technologies of <a href="/wiki/Literacy" title="Literacy">literacy</a> (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  
</p><p>Ong drew heavily on the work of <a href="/wiki/Eric_A._Havelock" title="Eric A. Havelock">Eric A.

<p>This 600-page selection of Ong's works is organized on the themes of orality and rhetoric. It includes his 1967 encyclopedia article on the "Written Transmission of Literature" (331-44); his most frequently cited article, his 1975 <i>PMLA</i> article "The Writer's Audience Is Always a Fiction" (405-27); and his most frequently reprinted article, his 1978 <i>ADE Bulletin</i> article "Literacy and Orality in Our Times" (465-78).
