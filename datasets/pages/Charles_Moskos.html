<p>Moskos was born May 20, 1934, in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a> to <a href="/wiki/Greek_people" title="Greek people" class="mw-redirect">Greek</a> immigrant parents from southern <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a> (<a href="/wiki/Northern_Epirus" title="Northern Epirus">Northern Epirus</a>). In his book <i>Greek Americans: Struggle and Success</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> which he jokingly called "his bestseller" bought only by <a href="/wiki/Greek_Americans" title="Greek Americans">Greek Americans</a>, he recalled that his father, christened Photios, adopted the name Charles after pulling it out of a hat full of "slips with appropriately American-sounding first names."
</p><p>Charles Moskos attended <a href="/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>, where he graduated <i>cum laude</i> in 1956, on tuition scholarship and waited tables to pay for room and board. He was drafted into the U.S. Army right after graduation in 1956. Moskos served with the Army's combat engineers in Germany where he wrote his first article, <i>"Has the Army Killed Jim Crow?"</i> for the <i>Negro History Bulletin</i>. After leaving the military, he enrolled at <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles" title="University of California, Los Angeles">UCLA</a>, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees in 1963.

<p>His first teaching job was at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, but he was soon recruited to <a href="/wiki/Northwestern_University" title="Northwestern University">Northwestern University</a>, where he was one of the most popular sociology professors in the school.<sup id="cite_ref-Taubeneck_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Taubeneck-2">[2]</a></sup> "Students rush to his classes to hear enthralling lectures peppered with cheesy jokes and anecdotes," the <i>Daily Northwestern</i> recalled in a May 2008 editorial, written the month before his death. "They may be drawn by his famed don't-ask-don't-tell military policy, but they stick around to experience his grandfather-like interactions that make every student feel personally addressed."
</p><p>Along with a number of other notable <a href="/wiki/Greek_Americans" title="Greek Americans">Greek Americans</a>, he was a founding member of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=The_Next_Generation_Initiative&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Next Generation Initiative (page does not exist)">Next Generation Initiative</a>, a leadership program aimed at getting students involved in public affairs.
</p><p>Moskos took many research trips to war-torn countries. He visited American troops in Vietnam (1965 and 1967); the Dominican Republic (1966); Honduras (1984); Panama (1989); Saudi Arabia (1991); Somalia (1993); Haiti (1994); Macedonia (1995); Hungary (1996); Bosnia and the Serb Republic (1996 and 1998); Kosovo (2000); Kuwait, Qatar, and Iraq (2003). Non-American military visits include: United Nations Force in Cyprus (1969–70), Italian Army in Albania (1994), Greek Army in Bosnia (1998), British Army in Iraq (2003).
</p><p>Moskos also advocated restoring the military draft. He insisted that enforcing a shared military experience for Americans of different classes, races and economic backgrounds forged a sense of common purpose. "This shared experience helped instill in those who served, as in the national culture generally, a sense of unity and moral seriousness that we would not see again -- until after September 11, 2001," he wrote in a November 2001 article in <i>Washington Monthly</i> (with Paul Glastris). "It's a shame that it has taken terrorist attacks to awaken us to the reality of our shared national fate."
</p><p>Charles Moskos was a respected source for the military and the media and his influence in the military went very high.<sup id="cite_ref-Taubeneck_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Taubeneck-2">[2]</a></sup> Military commanders such as Gen. <a href="/wiki/James_L._Jones" title="James L.

He was also the author of <i>All That We Can Be: Black Leadership And Racial Integration The Army Way</i>, which won the Washington Monthly award for the best political book of 1996. In addition, he published well over one hundred articles in scholarly journals and news publications such as the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and the <i>New Republic</i>.

<p>What Moskos called his "real fame" came when he coined the phrase "don't ask, don't tell". In 1993, to help break an impasse between the Clinton administration and military leadership over the status of gays in the military, Moskos devised a compromise policy and coined the phrase "<a href="/wiki/Don%27t_ask,_don%27t_tell" title="Don't ask, don't tell">don't ask, don't tell</a>". Originally suggested as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Don't Seek, Don't Flaunt" to Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman Senator Sam Nunn, it was eventually shortened to "don't ask, don't tell". Secretary of Defense <a href="/wiki/Les_Aspin" title="Les Aspin">Les Aspin</a> approved the policy, and it was recommended to the President. In the following months, Moskos worked with the White House, the Armed Forces, and the Senate Armed Forces Committee to draft the policy, which eventually was adopted.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>In 2000, Moskos told academic journal <i><a href="/wiki/Lingua_Franca_(magazine)" title="Lingua Franca (magazine)">Lingua Franca</a></i> that he felt the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy would be gone within five to ten years. He criticized the <a href="/wiki/Unit_cohesion" title="Unit cohesion">unit cohesion</a> argument, the most frequent rationale for the continued exclusion of gay and lesbian service members from the U.S. military. Instead he argued that since it was established that "modesty rights" require that women have separate bathrooms and showers, heterosexuals also had modesty rights: "I should not be forced to shower with a woman. I should not be forced to shower with a gay."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Moskos's comments were met with outrage by gay activists and Northwestern University students who argued that his fear of being eyed in the shower was not sufficient justification for denying equal rights to gay men and lesbians.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.
