<p>Barfield was born in London. He was educated at <a href="/wiki/Highgate_School" title="Highgate School">Highgate School</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wadham_College,_Oxford" title="Wadham College, Oxford">Wadham College, Oxford</a> and in 1920 received a first class degree in English language and literature. After finishing his B. Litt., which became his third book <i>Poetic Diction</i>, he was a dedicated poet and author for over ten years. After 1934 his profession was as a solicitor in London, from which he retired in 1959 aged 60. Thereafter he had many guest appointments as Visiting Professor in North America. Barfield published numerous essays, books, and articles. His primary focus was on what he called the "evolution of consciousness," which is an idea which occurs frequently in his writings. He is best known as the author of <i><a href="/wiki/Saving_the_Appearances:_A_Study_in_Idolatry" title="Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry">Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry</a></i> and as a founding father of <a href="/wiki/Anthroposophy" title="Anthroposophy">Anthroposophy</a> in the English speaking world.

<p>Barfield has been known as "the first and last <a href="/wiki/Inklings" title="Inklings">Inkling</a>". He had a profound influence on <a href="/wiki/C._S._Lewis" title="C. S. Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>, and through his books <i>The Silver Trumpet</i> and <i>Poetic Diction</i> (dedicated to C.S. Lewis), an appreciable effect on <a href="/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
Lewis was a good friend of Barfield since 1919, and termed Barfield "the wisest and best of my unofficial teachers."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> That Barfield did not consider philosophy merely intellectually is illustrated by a well-known interchange that took place between Lewis and Barfield. 
Lewis one day made the mistake of referring to philosophy as "a subject."  "It wasn't a <i>subject</i> to Plato," said Barfield, "It was a way."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Lewis refers to Barfield as the "Second Friend" in <i>Surprised by Joy</i>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But the Second Friend is the man who disagrees with you about everything. He is not so much the <i>alter ego</i> as the antiself. Of course he shares your interests; otherwise he would not become your friend at all. But he has approached them all at a different angle. He has read all the right books but has got the wrong thing out of every one. It is as if he spoke your language but mispronounced it. How can he be so nearly right and yet, invariably, just not right?<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Barfield and C. S. Lewis met in 1919 and were close friends for 44 years. Barfield was instrumental in converting Lewis to theism during the early period of their friendship which they affectionately called 'The Great War'. Maud also guided Lewis. As well as being friend and teacher to Lewis, Barfield was his legal adviser and trustee. Lewis dedicated his 1936 book <i><a href="/wiki/Allegory_of_Love" title="Allegory of Love" class="mw-redirect">Allegory of Love</a></i> to Barfield. Lewis wrote his 1949 book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe" title="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a></i> for <a href="/wiki/Lucy_Barfield" title="Lucy Barfield">Lucy Barfield</a> and he dedicated <i><a href="/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader" title="The Voyage of the Dawn Treader">The Voyage of the Dawn Treader</a></i> to Geoffrey in 1952.

<p>Barfield became an <a href="/wiki/Anthroposophy" title="Anthroposophy">anthroposophist</a> after attending a lecture by <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner" title="Rudolf Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a> in 1924.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> He studied the work and philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Steiner" title="Rudolf Steiner">Rudolf Steiner</a> throughout his life and translated some of his works, and had some early essays published in anthroposophical publications. This part of Barfield's literary work includes the book <i>The Case for Anthroposophy</i> containing his Introduction to selected extracts from Steiner's <i>Riddles of the Soul</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> A study of Steiner's basic texts provides information on some of the ideas that influenced Barfield's work,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> but Barfield's work ought not be considered derivative of Steiner's. Barfield expert G. B. Tennyson suggests the relation: "Barfield is to Steiner as Steiner was to Goethe".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> But though Barfield's writing was profoundly original and not derivative, he would not have agreed with Tennyson's characterization. Barfield considered Steiner a much greater man and mind than Goethe. From that point of view, Tennyson's analogy implies that Barfield was much greater than Steiner.  But Barfield considered himself very small beside Steiner, or Goethe. (Tennyson may have meant the analogy to suggest influence, rather than relative stature.)

<p>Barfield's <i>Poetic Diction</i> opens with examples of "felt changes" arising in reading poetry, and discusses how these relate to general principles of poetic composition. But Barfield's greater agenda is "a study of meaning". Using poetic examples, he attempts to demonstrate how the imagination works with words and metaphors to create meaning. 
He shows how the imagination of the poet creates new meaning, and how this same process has been active, throughout human experience, to create and continuously expand language. For Barfield this is not just literary criticism: 
it is evidence for the evolution of human consciousness. This, for many readers, is his real accomplishment: his unique presentation of "not merely a theory of poetic diction, but a theory of poetry, and not merely a theory of poetry, but a theory of knowledge". This theory was developed directly from a close study of the evolution of words and meaning, starting with the relation between the primitive mind's myth making capacity, and the formation of words. Barfield uses numerous examples to demonstrate that words originally had a unified "concrete and undivided" meaning, which we now distinguish as several distinct concepts. 
For example, the single Greek word <i>pneuma</i> (which can be variously translated as "breath", "spirit", or "wind") reflects, Barfield argues, the primordial unity of these concepts of air, spirit, wind, and breath, all included in one "holophrase". This Barfield considers not the application of analogy to natural phenomena, but the discernment of its pre-existence. This is the perspective Barfield believes is original in the evolution of consciousness, which was "fighting for its life", as he phrases it, in the philosophy of Plato, and which, in a regenerate and more sophisticated form, benefiting from the development of rational thought, needs to be recovered if consciousness is to continue to evolve.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>Barfield's <i>Worlds Apart</i> is one of his most important books. It is a fictional dialogue between a physicist, a biologist, a psychiatrist, a lawyer-philologist, a linguistic analyst, a theologian, a retired <a href="/wiki/Waldorf_School" title="Waldorf School" class="mw-redirect">Waldorf School</a> teacher, and a young man employed at a rocket research station.

<p><i>Saving the Appearances</i> explores some three thousand years of history—particularly the history of human consciousness. Barfield argues that the evolution of nature is inseparable from the evolution of consciousness. What we call matter interacts with mind and wouldn't exist without it.  In Barfield's lexicon, there is an "unrepresented" underlying base of reality that is extra-mental.  This is comparable to Kant's notion of the "<a href="/wiki/Noumenon#Overview" title="Noumenon">noumenal</a> world".<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> However, unlike Kant, Barfield entertained the idea that the "unrepresented" could be directly experienced, under some conditions.
</p><p>Similar conclusions have been made by others, and the book has influenced, for example, the physicist <a href="/w/index.php?title=Stephen_Edelglass&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Stephen Edelglass (page does not exist)">Stephen Edelglass</a> (who wrote <i>The Marriage of Sense and Thought</i>), and the Christian existentialist philosopher <a href="/wiki/Gabriel_Marcel" title="Gabriel Marcel">Gabriel Marcel</a>, who wanted the book to be translated into French.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>
</p>
Barfield points out that the "real" world of physics and particles is completely different from the world we see and live in of things with properties.<blockquote class="templatequote">In our critical thinking as physicists or philosophers, we imagine ourselves set over against an objective world consisting of particles, in which we do not participate at all. In contrast, the phenomenal, or familiar, world is said to be riddled with our subjectivity. In our daily, uncritical thinking, on the other hand, we take for granted the solid, objective reality of the familiar world, assume an objective, lawful manifestation of its qualities such as color, sound, and solidity, and even write natural scientific treatises about the history of its phenomena—all while ignoring the human consciousness that (by our own, critical account) determines these phenomena from the inside in a continually changing way.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
</blockquote> The particle world of physics is independent of human thought, and only indirectly accessible to humans. The world we see and perceive directly is dependent on and alterable by human thought (this is not to say there aren't or are limits.) Both are 'real' or 'unreal' depending on the meaning of real; that this changes over time in human thought is exactly Barfield's point.
