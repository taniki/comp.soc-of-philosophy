Moncure</a> served on what later became the <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Supreme_Court" title="Virginia Supreme Court" class="mw-redirect">Virginia Supreme Court</a> as well as a layman in the Episcopal Church and became known for his integrity and hatred of intolerance; and his great uncle <a href="/wiki/Peter_Vivian_Daniel" title="Peter Vivian Daniel">Peter Vivian Daniel</a> served on the United States Supreme Court, where he upheld slavery and the <a href="/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850" title="Fugitive Slave Act of 1850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a>, including in the <a href="/wiki/Dred_Scott_Decision" title="Dred Scott Decision" class="mw-redirect">Dred Scott Decision</a> of 1857. Two of Moncure Conway's three brothers later fought for the Confederacy. His opposition to slavery reportedly came from his mother's side of the family, including his great-grandfather Travers Daniel (justice of the Stafford Court, d. 1824)<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and his mother herself (who fled to <a href="/wiki/Easton,_Pennsylvania" title="Easton, Pennsylvania">Easton, Pennsylvania</a> and lived with her daughter and son-in-law Professor Marsh after the Civil War broke out), as well as from his boyhood experiences. Nonetheless, during his youth, Moncure Conway briefly took a pro-slavery position under the influence of a cousin, Richmond editor <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Moncure_Daniel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John Moncure Daniel (page does not exist)">John Moncure Daniel</a>, himself a protege of justice Daniel.

During his time at Dickinson, Conway helped found the college's first student publication and fell under the influence of Professor <a href="/wiki/John_McClintock_(theologian)" title="John McClintock (theologian)">John McClintock</a>, which caused him to embrace Methodism as well as an anti-slavery position, although that controversy was starting to split the denomination. In Fredericksburg, uncle Eustace funded the pro-slavery Southern Conference faction and his father the at-least-theoretically anti-slavery Baltimore Conference faction.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

Despite the previous tension with his own family over his opposition to slavery, Moncure Conway nevertheless brought his bride to meet them, during which Ellen broke a Southern social constraint by hugging and kissing a young slave girl in front of family members; after this, it would take 17 years before Conway reconciled with his family.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Conway had self-published his first pamphlet in 1850, "Free Schools in Virginia: A Plea of Education, Virtue and Thrift, vs. Ignorance, Vice and Poverty," but had been unable to convince local politicians to follow his recommendations, particularly as the pro-slavery faction believed such universal education influenced by Northern mores.<sup id="cite_ref-encyclopediavirginia.org_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-encyclopediavirginia.org-7">[7]</a></sup> His Rockville Circuit included his native state and <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> through <a href="/wiki/Rockville,_Maryland" title="Rockville, Maryland">Rockville, Maryland</a>, where he became acquainted with the Quaker <a href="/wiki/Roger_Brooke" title="Roger Brooke">Roger Brooke</a>, whom he considered his first avowed abolitionist, despite his familial relation to the jurist <a href="/wiki/Roger_Brooke_Taney" title="Roger Brooke Taney" class="mw-redirect">Roger Brooke Taney</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> In 1853, after being reassigned to a circuit around <a href="/wiki/Frederick,_Maryland" title="Frederick, Maryland">Frederick, Maryland</a> and shortly after his beloved elder brother Peyton died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and his assistant Becky of another, Moncure Conway left the Methodist church and entered the <a href="/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a> school of divinity to continue his spiritual journey.

<p>After graduating from Harvard, Conway accepted a call to the <a href="/wiki/All_Souls_Church,_Unitarian_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.)">First Unitarian Church</a> of <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, but he was invited to seek another position after enunciating abolitionist views. Moreover, when Conway returned to his native Virginia, his rumored connection with an attempt to rescue the fugitive slave <a href="/wiki/Anthony_Burns" title="Anthony Burns">Anthony Burns</a> in <a href="/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Boston, Massachusetts" class="mw-redirect">Boston, Massachusetts</a> (whose master Conway had known in Stafford, Virginia before their move to Alexandria, and who was ultimately purchased by an abolitionist and set free) aroused bitter hostility among his old neighbors and friends, as well as family. Conway fled being tarred and feathered in 1854.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>Nonetheless, almost at once, Conway was invited to preach sermons at the <a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" title="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> congregation in <a href="/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="Cincinnati, Ohio" class="mw-redirect">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. He served as minister at that anti-slavery congregation from late 1855 until after the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. However, when in 1859, he announced to the congregation that he no longer believed in miracles or Christ's divinity, a third of the congregation left—but the "Free Church" survived.<sup id="cite_ref-encyclopediavirginia.org_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-encyclopediavirginia.org-7">[7]</a></sup> Conway also edited a short-lived liberal periodical called <i>The Dial</i> in 1860-1861, linking his emerging spiritual views to his Transcendentalist background. In Cincinnati he became more acquainted with Jews and Catholics, and counseled against discriminating against them because of their religions. However, not all his abolitionist friends agreed with his pacificism, especially his condemnation of John Brown' raid at Harper's Ferry (though he also expressed disappointment at Virginia's bellicose response).

<p>Conway had become editor of the anti-slavery weekly <i>Commonwealth</i> in <a href="/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Boston, Massachusetts" class="mw-redirect">Boston</a>, and in 1861, Conway published semi-anonymously <i>The Rejected Stone; or Insurrection vs. Resurrection in America</i>, identifying himself only as a "Native of Virginia". The book was published in three editions and ultimately handed out to Union soldiers after the start of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>. During the next year, Conway advocated abolition, including in a Smithsonian lecture series in Washington, D.C., which earned him and the more moderate Unitarian minister <a href="/wiki/William_Henry_Channing" title="William Henry Channing">William Henry Channing</a> a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln to discuss his argument that announcing abolition would weaken the Confederacy. While in Washington, D.C., Conway located several dozen of his father's slaves who had fled from Virginia into Georgetown. Conway secured train tickets and safe-conduct passes for them, and escorted them on a dangerous trip through Maryland to safety in <a href="/wiki/Yellow_Springs,_Ohio" title="Yellow Springs, Ohio">Yellow Springs, Ohio</a>, where he believed they would be safe due to the town's accepting culture.<sup id="cite_ref-nps.gov_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nps.gov-3">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-washingtonpost.com_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-washingtonpost.com-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>During the Union occupation before the devastating <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg" title="Battle of Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>, Conway also returned home to Falmouth in 1862, and learned that his family's house had been spared from destruction because of its association with him, although it was commandeered for use as a hospital for wounded soldiers (at which <a href="/wiki/Walt_Whitman" title="Walt Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> would nurse).<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>  That year, Conway published another powerful plea for emancipation, <i>The Golden Hour</i> (1862). On New Year's Day, 1863 (also called Emancipation Day, because President Lincoln issued the <a href="/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation" title="Emancipation Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, news of which reached Boston by telegraph), Conway with fellow abolitionists <a href="/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe" title="Julia Ward Howe">Julia Ward Howe</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bronson_Alcott" title="Bronson Alcott" class="mw-redirect">Bronson Alcott</a>, <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Wendell_Holmes_Sr." title="Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr." class="mw-redirect">Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr.</a>, <a href="/wiki/George_Luther_Stearns" title="George Luther Stearns">George Luther Stearns</a> and <a href="/wiki/Wendell_Phillips" title="Wendell Phillips">Wendell Phillips</a> unveiled a marble bust of <a href="/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)" title="John Brown (abolitionist)">John Brown</a> at Stearns' home.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>In April 1863<sup id="cite_ref-archives.dickinson.edu_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-archives.dickinson.edu-2">[2]</a></sup> Fellow American abolitionists sent Conway to London to convince the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> that the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> was primarily a war of abolition and to not support the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>.

Mason publicly rejected the overture, embarrassing Conway's sponsors, who quickly and angrily withdrew support. Moreover, Conway had to apologize to U.S. Secretary of State <a href="/wiki/William_H._Seward" title="William H. Seward">William H.

<p>Rather than go back to America, where Conway no longer felt welcome as a suspected traitor to his childhood Virginia friends and neighbors, and where he paid someone to take his place after being drafted to serve in the Union army, Conway traveled to Italy. There he reunited with his wife and children in <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a> before moving back to London. There in 1864 he became minister of the South Place Chapel (serving in 1864–65 and 1893–97) as well as leader of the then named <a href="/wiki/South_Place_Religious_Society" title="South Place Religious Society" class="mw-redirect">South Place Religious Society</a> in <a href="/wiki/Finsbury,_London,_England" title="Finsbury, London, England" class="mw-redirect">Finsbury, London</a>.

However, the audience consisted of well-dressed lower-middle-class people.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
Conway remained the leader of South Place until 1886, when <a href="/wiki/Stanton_Coit" title="Stanton Coit">Stanton Coit</a> took his place. Under Coit's leadership South Place was renamed to the <a href="/wiki/Conway_Hall_Ethical_Society" title="Conway Hall Ethical Society">South Place Ethical Society</a>.
