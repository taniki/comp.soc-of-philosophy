<p><b>Hans Joachim Morgenthau</b> (February 17, 1904 – July 19, 1980) was one of the major twentieth-century figures in the study of <a href="/wiki/International_relations" title="International relations">international politics</a>.

His <i><a href="/wiki/Politics_Among_Nations" title="Politics Among Nations">Politics Among Nations</a></i>, first published in 1948, went through five editions during his lifetime.

<p>Morgenthau was born in an <a href="/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jewish" title="Ashkenazi Jewish" class="mw-redirect">Ashkenazi Jewish</a> family in <a href="/wiki/Coburg" title="Coburg">Coburg</a>, <a href="/wiki/Saxe-Coburg_and_Gotha" title="Saxe-Coburg and Gotha">Saxe-Coburg and Gotha</a>, <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" title="German Empire">Germany</a> in 1904, and, after attending <a href="/wiki/Casimirianum_Coburg" title="Casimirianum Coburg">Casimirianum</a>, was educated at the universities of <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a>, and pursued postdoctoral work at the <a href="/wiki/Graduate_Institute_of_International_Studies" title="Graduate Institute of International Studies" class="mw-redirect">Graduate Institute of International Studies</a> in <a href="/wiki/Geneva" title="Geneva">Geneva</a>, <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. He taught and practiced law in Frankfurt before emigrating to the United States in 1937, after several interim years in Switzerland and <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. Morgenthau taught in <a href="/wiki/Kansas_City" title="Kansas City" class="mw-redirect">Kansas City</a> from 1939–1943, during which time he attended the Keneseth Israel Shalom Congregation.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Morgenthau then taught at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a> until 1973, when he moved to New York and took a professorial chair at the City University of New York (CUNY).
</p><p>On moving to New York, Morgenthau separated from his wife, who remained in Chicago partly due to medical issues. He is reported twice to have tried to initiate plans to start a new family while in New York, once with the political philosopher <a href="/wiki/Hannah_Arendt" title="Hannah Arendt">Hannah Arendt</a> as documented by her biographer,<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and a second time with <a href="/wiki/Ethel_Person" title="Ethel Person">Ethel Person</a> (d. 2012), a medical professor at Columbia University (she documents this in her essay for the Morgenthau Centenary in 2004).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>On October 8, 1979, Morgenthau was one of the passengers on board <a href="/wiki/Swissair_Flight_316" title="Swissair Flight 316">Swissair Flight 316</a>, which crashed while trying to land at <a href="/wiki/Ellinikon_International_Airport" title="Ellinikon International Airport">Athens-Ellinikon International Airport</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> while he was en route on a flight destined for Bombay and Peking.
</p><p>Morgenthau died after a brief hospitalization on July 19, 1980, after being admitted with a grave diagnosis of a perforated ulcer at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, according to the account recorded by Ethel Person.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>

<p>Morgenthau completed his doctoral dissertation in Germany in the late 1920s. It was published in 1929 as his first book, <i>The International Administration of Justice, Its Essence and Its Limits</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> The book was reviewed by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Schmitt" title="Carl Schmitt">Carl Schmitt</a>, who was then a jurist teaching at the University of Berlin. In an autobiographical essay written near the end of his life, Morgenthau related that despite initially anticipating meeting Schmitt while on a visit to Berlin, the meeting went badly and Morgenthau left thinking that he had been in the presence of, in his own words, "the demonic."<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> By the late 1920s Schmitt was becoming the leading jurist of the rising National Socialist movement in Germany, and Morgenthau came to see their positions as irreconcilable. (The editors of Morgenthau's <i>The Concept of the Political</i> [see below] state that "the reader of [Morgenthau's] <i>The Concept of the Political</i> ... will easily recognize that Morgenthau deplored Schmitt's understanding of the political on moral grounds and conceptual grounds.")<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>Following completion of his doctoral dissertation, Morgenthau left Germany to complete his Habilitation dissertation (license to teach at universities) in Geneva. It was published (in French) as <i>The Reality of Norms and in Particular the Norms of International Law: Foundations of a Theory of Norms</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The legal scholar <a href="/wiki/Hans_Kelsen" title="Hans Kelsen">Hans Kelsen</a>, who had just arrived in Geneva as a professor, was an adviser to Morgenthau's dissertation. Kelsen was among the strongest critics of <a href="/wiki/Carl_Schmitt" title="Carl Schmitt">Carl Schmitt</a>. Kelsen and Morgenthau became lifelong colleagues even after both emigrated from Europe to take their respective academic positions in the United States.
</p><p>In 1933, Morgenthau wrote a second book in French, <i>The Concept of the Political,</i> which was translated into English in 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> In this book Morgenthau sought to articulate the difference between legal disputes between nations and political disputes between nations or other litigants. The questions driving the inquiry were: (i) Who holds legal power over the objects or concerns being disputed, (ii) In what manner can the holder of this legal power be changed or held accountable; (iii) How can a dispute, the object of which concerns a legal power, be resolved; and (iv) In what manner will the holder of the legal power be protected in the course of exercising that power. The end goal of any legal system in this context for Morgenthau is to "ensure justice and peace."
</p><p>Morgenthau sought in the 1920s and 1930s a realist alternative to mainstream international law, a quest for "functional jurisprudence". He borrowed ideas from <a href="/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Max_Weber" title="Max Weber">Max Weber</a>, <a href="/wiki/Roscoe_Pound" title="Roscoe Pound">Roscoe Pound</a>, and others.
</p><p>In 1940 Morgenthau set out a research program for legal functionalism in the article "Positivism, Functionalism, and International Law".<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Francis_Boyle" title="Francis Boyle">Francis Boyle</a> has written that Morgenthau's post-war writings perhaps contributed to a "break between international political science and international legal studies." <sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> However, <i>Politics Among Nations</i> contains a  chapter on international law, and Morgenthau remained an active contributor to the subject of the relationship between international politics and international law until the end of his career.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>Hans Morgenthau is considered one of the "founding fathers" of the <a href="/wiki/Realism_in_international_relations" title="Realism in international relations" class="mw-redirect">realist school</a> in the 20th century. This school of thought holds that nation-states are the main actors in international relations and that the main concern of the field is the study of <a href="/wiki/Power_in_international_relations" title="Power in international relations" class="mw-redirect">power</a>. Morgenthau emphasized the importance of "the national interest", and in <i>Politics Among Nations</i> he wrote that "the main signpost that helps political realism to find its way through the landscape of international politics is the concept of interest defined in terms of power." Morgenthau is sometimes referred to as a <a href="/wiki/Classical_realism_in_international_relations_theory" title="Classical realism in international relations theory" class="mw-redirect">classical realist</a> or modern realist in order to differentiate his approach from the <a href="/wiki/Neorealism_(international_relations)" title="Neorealism (international relations)">structural realism or neo-realism</a> associated with <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Waltz" title="Kenneth Waltz">Kenneth Waltz</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>

<p>Recent scholarly assessments of Morgenthau show that his intellectual trajectory was more complicated than originally thought.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> His realism was infused with moral considerations, and during the last part of his life he favored supranational control of nuclear weapons and strongly opposed the U.S. role in the Vietnam War (see below).<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> His book <i><a href="/wiki/Scientific_Man_versus_Power_Politics" title="Scientific Man versus Power Politics">Scientific Man versus Power Politics</a></i> (1946) argued against an overreliance on science and technology as solutions to political and social problems.
</p><p>Starting with the second edition of <i>Politics Among Nations</i>, Morgenthau included a section in the opening chapter called "Six Principles of Political Realism".<sup id="cite_ref-PAN-4-15_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-PAN-4-15-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>The principles, paraphrased, are:
</p>
<ol><li> Political realism believes that politics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in human nature.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></li>
<li> The main signpost of political realism is the concept of interest defined in terms of <a href="/wiki/Power_in_international_relations" title="Power in international relations" class="mw-redirect">power</a>, which infuses rational order into the subject matter of politics, and thus makes the theoretical understanding of politics possible. Political realism avoids concerns with the <a href="/wiki/Motivation" title="Motivation">motives</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ideology" title="Ideology">ideology</a> of <a href="/wiki/Politician" title="Politician">statesmen</a>. Political realism avoids reinterpreting reality to fit the policy. A good foreign policy minimizes risks and maximizes benefits.</li>
<li> Realism recognizes that the determining kind of interest varies depending on the political and cultural context in which foreign policy, not to be confused with a theory of international politics, is made. It does not give "interest defined as power" a meaning that is fixed once and for all.</li>
<li> Political realism is aware of the moral significance of political action. It is also aware of the tension between the moral command and the requirements of successful political action. Realism maintains that universal moral principles must be filtered through the concrete circumstances of time and place, because they cannot be applied to the actions of states in their abstract universal formulation.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup></li>
<li> Political realism refuses to identify the moral aspirations of a particular nation with the moral laws that govern the universe.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup></li>
<li> The political realist maintains the autonomy of the political sphere; the statesman asks "How does this policy affect the power and interests of the nation?" Political realism is based on a pluralistic conception of human nature. The political realist must show where the nation's interests differ from the <a href="/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">moralistic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Liberal_legalism" title="Liberal legalism">legalistic</a> viewpoints.</li></ol>

Morgenthau dedicated the book to <a href="/wiki/Hans_Kelsen" title="Hans Kelsen">Hans Kelsen</a>, "who has taught us through his example how to speak Truth to Power." Morgenthau's last major book, <i>Science: Servant or Master,</i> was dedicated to his colleague <a href="/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr" title="Reinhold Niebuhr">Reinhold Niebuhr</a> and published in 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>

</p><p>In summer 1978, Morgenthau wrote his last co-authored essay titled "The Roots of Narcissism," with Ethel Person of Columbia University.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39">[39]</a></sup> This essay was a continuation of Morgenthau's earlier study of this subject in his 1962 essay "Public Affairs: Love and Power," where Morgenthau engaged some of the themes that Niebuhr and the theologian Paul Tillich were addressing.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40">[40]</a></sup> Morgenthau was taken by his encounter with Tillich's book <i>Love, Power and Justice,</i> and he wrote a second essay related to the book's themes.<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup> More recently, Anthony Lang has recovered and published Morgenthau's extensive course notes on Aristotle (for a course Morgenthau taught while at the New School for Social Research during his New York years).<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42">[42]</a></sup> The comparison of Morgenthau to Aristotle has been further explored by Molloy.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43">[43]</a></sup>
</p><p>Morgenthau was a tireless reviewer of books during the several decades of his career as a scholar in the United States. The number of book reviews he wrote approached nearly a hundred, and included almost three dozen book reviews for <i>The New York Review of Books</i> alone. Morgenthau's last two book reviews were not written for <i>The New York Review of Books</i> and were of the books <i>Soviet Perspectives on International Relations; 1956–1967</i>, by William Zimmerman<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44">[44]</a></sup> and <i>Work, Society and Culture</i> by Yves Simon.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45">[45]</a></sup> The last book review Morgenthau wrote for <i>The New York Review of Books</i> appeared in 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46">[46]</a></sup> Morgenthau's first book review, written in 1940, was of <i>Law, the State, and the International Community</i>, by James Brown Scott.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47">[47]</a></sup> Morgenthau also commented on the Pentagon Papers.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

<p>The reception of Morgenthau's work can be divided into three phases. The first phase occurred during Morgenthau's life up to his death in 1980. The second phase of the discussion of his writings and contributions to the study of international politics and international law was between 1980 and the one hundred year commemoration of his birth that took place in 2004. The third phase of the reception of his writings is between the centenary commemoration and the present, which shows a vibrant discussion of his continuing influence.

<p>In his very early career from the 1920s, the book review by <a href="/wiki/Carl_Schmitt" title="Carl Schmitt">Carl Schmitt</a> of Morgenthau's dissertation had a lasting and negative effect on Morgenthau. Schmitt had become a leading juristic voice for the rising National Socialist movement in Germany and Morgenthau came to see their positions as incommensurable. Within five years of this, Morgenthau met <a href="/wiki/Hans_Kelsen" title="Hans Kelsen">Hans Kelsen</a> at Geneva while a student, and Kelsen's treatment of Morgenthau's writings left a lifelong positive impression upon the young Morgenthau. Kelsen in the 1920s had emerged as Schmitt's most thorough critic and had earned a reputation as a leading international critic of the then rising National Socialist movement in Germany, which matched Morgenthau's own negative opinion of Nazism.

<p>Morgenthau's <i>Politics Among Nations</i> (1948) had a large influence on a  generation of scholars in global politics and international law. From within the realist perspective, <a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Waltz" title="Kenneth Waltz">Kenneth Waltz</a> urged more attention to purely 'structural' elements of the international system, especially the distribution of capabilities among states. Waltz's neorealism was more self-consciously scientific than Morgenthau's version of realism.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup>
</p><p>Morgenthau's concern with the issues of nuclear weapons and the arms race <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> led to discussions and debates with Henry Kissinger and others.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> Morgenthau saw many aspects of the nuclear arms race as a form of irrational madness requiring the attention of responsible diplomats, statesmen and scholars.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup>
</p><p>Morgenthau remained throughout the Cold War an active participant in the discussion of U.S. foreign policy. He wrote in this connection about Kissinger and his role in the Nixon administration.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>
Morgenthau in 1977 also wrote a brief "Foreword" on the theme of terrorism as it began to emerge in the 1970s.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>

<p>Christoph Frei's intellectual biography of Morgenthau, published in English translation in 2001 (from the earlier German edition)<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62">[62]</a></sup> was one of the first of many substantial publications about Morgenthau in the 2000s.

</p><p><a href="/wiki/John_Mearsheimer" title="John Mearsheimer">John Mearsheimer</a> of the University of Chicago has studied the relationship of Morgenthau's political realism to the neo-conservativism prevailing during the G.W.
