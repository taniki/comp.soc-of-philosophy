<p>John Hick was born on 20 January 1922 to a middle-class family in <a href="/wiki/Scarborough,_North_Yorkshire" title="Scarborough, North Yorkshire">Scarborough</a>, England. In his teens, he developed an interest in philosophy and religion, being encouraged by his uncle, who was an author and teacher at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Manchester" title="University of Manchester">University of Manchester</a>. Hick initially pursued a <a href="/wiki/Law_degree" title="Law degree">law degree</a> at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Hull" title="University of Hull">University of Hull</a>, but, having converted to <a href="/wiki/Evangelical_Christianity" title="Evangelical Christianity" class="mw-redirect">Evangelical Christianity</a>, he decided to change his career and he enrolled at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> in 1941.
</p><p>During his studies, he became liable for military service in <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, but, as a <a href="/wiki/Conscientious_objector" title="Conscientious objector">conscientious objector</a> on moral grounds, he enrolled in the <a href="/wiki/Friends%27_Ambulance_Unit" title="Friends' Ambulance Unit">Friends' Ambulance Unit</a>.
</p><p>After the war, he returned to Edinburgh and became attracted to the philosophy of <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" title="Immanuel Kant">Immanuel Kant</a>, and began to question his fundamentalism. In 1948 he completed his MA thesis, which formed the basis of his book <i>Faith and Knowledge</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-peters_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-peters-3">[3]</a></sup> He went on to complete a <a href="/wiki/D._Phil" title="D.

<p>Hick's academic positions included Danforth Professor of the Philosophy of Religion at the <a href="/wiki/Claremont_Graduate_University" title="Claremont Graduate University">Claremont Graduate University</a>, California (where he taught from 1979 to 1992); H.G. Wood Professor of Theology at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Birmingham" title="University of Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>; and Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Research in Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Birmingham.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
While at the University of Birmingham Hick played important roles in a number of organizations centered on community relations.  Non-Christian communities, mostly Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh, had begun to form in this central England community as immigration from the Caribbean Islands and Indian subcontinent increased. Due to the influx of peoples with different religious traditions, organizations focused on integrating the community became necessary. During his fifteen years at the University of Birmingham, Hick became a founder, as well as the first chair, for the group All Faiths for One Race (AFFOR); he served as a chair on the Religious and Cultural Panel, which was a division of the Birmingham Community Relations Committee; and he also chaired the coordinating committee for a 1944 conference convened under the new Education Act with the aim of creating a new syllabus for religious instruction in city schools.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>He also held teaching positions at <a href="/wiki/Cornell_University" title="Cornell University">Cornell University</a>, <a href="/wiki/Princeton_Theological_Seminary" title="Princeton Theological Seminary">Princeton Theological Seminary</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cambridge_University" title="Cambridge University" class="mw-redirect">Cambridge University</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> During his teaching stay at Princeton Seminary, Hick began to depart from his conservative religious standings as he began to question "whether belief in the Incarnation required one to believe in the literal historicity of the Virgin Birth".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This questioning would open the door for further examination of his own Christology, which would contribute to Hick's understanding of religious pluralism. He was the Vice-President of <a href="/wiki/The_British_Society_for_the_Philosophy_of_Religion" title="The British Society for the Philosophy of Religion">the British Society for the Philosophy of Religion</a>, and Vice-President of The World Congress of Faiths.<sup id="cite_ref-giffordlectures_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-giffordlectures-12">[12]</a></sup>

</p><p>Hick was twice the subject of heresy proceedings. In 1961 or 1962, he was asked whether he took exception to anything in the Westminster Confession of 1647 and answered that several points were open to question. Because of this, some of the local ministers appealed against his reception into the Presbytery. Their appeal was sustained by the Synod. A year later, a counter-appeal was sustained by the Judicial Committee of the General Assembly, and Hick became a member of the Presbytery (see <a href="/wiki/Christian_heresy_in_the_20th_century" title="Christian heresy in the 20th century" class="mw-redirect">Christian heresy in the 20th century</a>).

<p>Robert Smid states that Hick is regularly cited as "one of the most – if not simply the most – significant philosopher of religion in the twentieth century".<sup id="cite_ref-smid_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-smid-14">[14]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Keith_Ward" title="Keith Ward">Keith Ward</a> once described him as "the greatest living philosopher of global religion."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> He is best known for his advocacy of <a href="/wiki/Religious_pluralism" title="Religious pluralism">religious pluralism</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-peters_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-peters-3">[3]</a></sup> which is radically different from the traditional Christian teachings that he held when he was younger.<sup id="cite_ref-dict_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dict-5">[5]</a></sup> Perhaps because of his heavy involvement with the inter-faith groups mentioned above under the "Career" heading and his interaction with people of non-Christian faiths through those groups, Hick began to move toward his pluralistic outlook on religion. He notes in both "More Than One Way?" and "God and the Universe of Faiths" that, as he came to know these people who belonged to non-Christian faiths, he saw in them the same values and moral actions that he recognized in fellow Christians.  This observation led him to begin questioning how a completely loving God could possibly sentence non-Christians who clearly espouse values that are revered in Christianity to an eternity in hell.  Hick then began to attempt to uncover the means by which all those devoted to a theistic religion might receive salvation.
</p><p>Hick has notably been criticized by then-Cardinal <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Ratzinger" title="Joseph Ratzinger" class="mw-redirect">Joseph Ratzinger</a> (who held the position of Pope Emeritus from 2005-2013), when he was head of the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Office" title="Holy Office" class="mw-redirect">Holy Office</a>.

Therefore, the declaration <i><a href="/wiki/Dominus_Iesus" title="Dominus Iesus">Dominus Iesus</a></i> was seen by many at the time as a condemnation of Hick's ideas and theories.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kantian_influences">Kantian influences</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Hick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Kantian influences">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Having begun his career as an evangelical, he moved towards pluralism as a way of reconciling God’s love with the facts of cultural and religious diversity. He is primarily influenced by Immanuel Kant in this regard, who argued that human minds obscure actual reality in favor of comprehension (see <a href="/wiki/Immanuel_Kant#Theory_of_perception" title="Immanuel Kant">Kant's theory of perception</a>). According to Richard Peters, for Hick, "[the] construal of the relationship of the human mind to God...is much like the relationship that Kant supposed exists between the human mind and the world".<sup id="cite_ref-peters_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-peters-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>It isn't fair to say that Hick is strictly Kantian, however. Peters notes "the divide between the '<a href="/wiki/Noumenal" title="Noumenal" class="mw-redirect">noumenal</a>' and '<a href="/wiki/Phenomenal" title="Phenomenal" class="mw-redirect">phenomenal</a>' realms (so far as nature is concerned) is not nearly so severe for Hick as it was for Kant".<sup id="cite_ref-peters_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-peters-3">[3]</a></sup> Hick also declares that the <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">Divine Being</a> is what he calls 'transcategorial'. We can experience God through categories, but God Himself obscures them by his very nature.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pluralism">Pluralism</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Hick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Pluralism">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In light of his Kantian influences, Hick claims that knowledge of the Real (his generic term for Transcendent Reality) can only be known as it is being perceived. For that reason, absolute truth claims about God (to use Christian language) are really truth claims about perceptions of God; that is, claims about the phenomenal God and not the noumenal God. Furthermore, because all knowledge is rooted in experience, which is then perceived and interpreted into human categories of conception, cultural and historical contexts which inevitably influence human perception are necessarily components of knowledge of the Real. This means that knowledge of God and religious truth claims pertaining thereof are culturally and historically influenced; and for that reason should not be considered absolute. This is a significant aspect of Hick's argument against Christian <a href="/wiki/Exclusivism" title="Exclusivism">exclusivism</a>, which holds that although other religions might contain partial goodness and truth, <a href="/wiki/Salvation" title="Salvation">salvation</a> is provided only in <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> Christ, and the complete truth of God is contained only in Christianity.
</p><p>Perhaps the simplest manner in which to understand Hick's theory of pluralism of religions is to share the comparison he makes between his own understanding of religion and the Copernican view of our solar system.  Before Copernicus disseminated his views of the solar centered universe, the Ptolemaic system ruled in which the stars were painted in the sky, and the sun rose and set around the earth.  In short, the rest of the universe existed for and was centered on our little planet.  On the other hand, Copernicus asserted that the earth, and other planets as well, circled the sun, which in fact, did not move, but only appeared to move due to the revolution of our planet.  Copernicus introduced our world to the understanding that other planets took similar paths around the sun; while each path differed, all served the same purpose and generated the same result:  every planet makes a full path around our central star. Rotation of a planet about its axis creates day and night for that planet, just as day and night occur on earth.  Although the time frames for a full trip around the sun and for a full day-night cycle differs on a planet-by-planet basis, the concept remains constant throughout our solar system.
</p><p>Similarly, Hick draws the metaphor that the Ptolemaic view of religion would be that Christianity is the only way to true salvation and knowledge of the one true God. Ptolemaic Christianity would assert that everything exists and all of history has played out in specific patterns for the glory of the Christian God, and that there is no other possible path that will lead to salvation.  Hick appears as Copernicus, offering the belief that perhaps all theistic religions are focused toward the one true God and simply take different paths to achieve the same goal.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>A speaker on religious pluralism, Keith E. Johnson, compares Hick's pluralistic theology to a tale of three blind men attempting to describe an elephant, one touching the leg, the second touching the trunk, the third feeling the elephant's side.  Each man describes the elephant differently, and, although each is accurate, each is also convinced of their own correctness and the mistakenness of the other two.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p>Robert Smid states that Hick believes that the tenets of Christianity are "no longer feasible in the present age, and must be effectively 'lowered'".<sup id="cite_ref-smid_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-smid-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>Moreover, Mark Mann notes that Hick argues that there have been people throughout history "who have been exemplars of the Real".<sup id="cite_ref-mann_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mann-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
</p><p>Hick's position is "not an exclusively Christian inclusivism [like that of Karl Rahner and his ‘Anonymous Christian’], but a plurality of mutually inclusive inclusivism." <sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Hick contends that the diverse religious expressions (religions) are the result of diverse historically and culturally influenced responses to diverse perceptions of the Real. He states that "the different religious traditions, with their complex internal differentiations, have developed to meet the needs of the range of mentalities expressed in the different human cultures." <sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hick.27s_Christology">Hick's Christology</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Hick&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Hick's Christology">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>In his "God and the Universe of Faiths", Hick attempts to pinpoint the essence of Christianity.  He first cites the Sermon on the Mount as being the basic Christian teaching, as it provides a practical way of living out the Christian faith.  He says that "christian essence is not to be found in beliefs about God...but in living as the disciples who in his name feed the hungry, heal the sick and create justice in the world."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> However, all of the teachings, including the Sermon on the Mount, that form what Hick calls the essence of Christianity, flow directly from Jesus' ministry.  In turn, this means that the birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus form the permanent basis of the Christian tradition.  Hick continues in this work to examine the manner in which the deification of Jesus took place in corporate Christianity following his crucifixion and questions whether or not Jesus actually thought of himself as the Messiah and the literal Son of God.
</p><p>In several places (e.g. his contributions to <i>The Metaphor of God Incarnate</i>, and his book <i><a href="/wiki/The_Myth_of_God_Incarnate" title="The Myth of God Incarnate">The Myth of God Incarnate</a></i>) Hick proposes a reinterpretation of traditional Christology—particularly the doctrine of the Incarnation. Hick contends "that the historical Jesus of Nazareth did not teach or apparently believe that he was God, or God the Son, Second Person of a Holy Trinity, incarnate, or the son of God in a unique sense."<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> It is for that reason, and perhaps for the sake of religious pluralism and peace, Hick proposes a metaphorical approach to incarnation. That is, Jesus (for example) was not literally God in the flesh (incarnate), but was metaphorically speaking, the presence of God. "Jesus was so open to divine inspiration, so responsive to the divine spirit, so obedient to God's will, that God was able to act on earth in and through him. This, I (Hick) believe, is the true Christian doctrine of the incarnation." <sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> Hick believes that a metaphorical view of the incarnation avoids the need for faulty Christian paradoxes such as the duality of Christ (fully God and fully human) and even the Trinity (God is simultaneously one and three).

<blockquote>Neither the intense christological debates of the centuries leading up to the Council of Chalcedon, nor the renewed christological debates of the 19th and 20th Centuries, have succeeded in squaring the circle by making intelligible the claim that one who was genuinely and unambiguously a man was also genuinely and unambiguously God.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup></blockquote>

<p>Hick has identified with a branch of theodicy that he calls "<a href="/wiki/Irenaean_theodicy" title="Irenaean theodicy">Irenaean theodicy</a>" or the "Soul-Making Defense".<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> A simplification of this view states that suffering exists as a means of spiritual development. In other words, God allows suffering so that human souls might grow or develop towards maturation. For Hick, God is ultimately responsible for pain and suffering, but such things are not truly bad. Perhaps with a greater degree of perception, one can see that the "evil" we experience through suffering is not ultimately evil but good, as such is used to "make our souls" better.
</p><p>Therefore, Hick sees the evils of pain and suffering as serving God’s good purpose of bringing "imperfect and immature" humanity to itself  "in uncompelled faith and love."<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> At the same time, Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">[28]</a></sup> However, in the after-life, Hick asserts that "God will eventually succeed in His purpose of winning all men to Himself."<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup>
</p><p>The discussion of evil in Hick has been challenged by a number of theologians and moral philosophers including David Griffin and John K. Roth. Using Hick's own words, Roth has stated, "Hick's theodicy is implausible to me because I am convinced that his claims about God's goodness cannot stand the onslaught of what he calls the principal threat to his own perspective: 'the sheer amount and intensity of both moral and natural evil.'"<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup> In the book <i>Encountering Evil</i>, Stephen Davis has stated his four criticisms of Hick, "First, while no theodicy is free of difficulties, I believe Hick's is not entirely convincing in its handling of the amount of evil that exists in the world... Second, I am dubious about Hick's hope of a gradual spiritual evolution till human beings reach a full state of God-consciousness... Third, I believe Hick also faces what I call the 'cost-effective' criticism of the free will defense...
