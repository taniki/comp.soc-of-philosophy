</p><p>Miliband was born in <a href="/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> to working-class <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland" title="History of the Jews in Poland">Polish Jewish</a> immigrants. He fled to the United Kingdom in 1940 with his father, to avoid persecution when <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> invaded Belgium. Learning to speak English and enrolling at the <a href="/wiki/London_School_of_Economics" title="London School of Economics">London School of Economics</a>, he became involved in left-wing politics and made a personal commitment to the cause of socialism at the grave of <a href="/wiki/Karl_Marx" title="Karl Marx">Karl Marx</a>. After serving in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> during the Second World War, he settled in London in 1946 and naturalised as a British subject in 1948.
</p><p>By the 1960s, he was a prominent member of the <a href="/wiki/New_Left" title="New Left">New Left</a> movement in Britain, which was critical of established Socialist governments in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and Central Europe (the <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc" title="Eastern Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a>). He published several books on Marxist theory and the criticism of capitalism, such as <i>Parliamentary Socialism</i> (1961), <i>The State in Capitalist Society</i> (1969) and <i>Marxism and Politics</i> (1977).
</p><p>Both of his sons, <a href="/wiki/David_Miliband" title="David Miliband">David</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ed_Miliband" title="Ed Miliband">Ed Miliband</a>, went on to become senior members of the <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> following their father's death.

They missed the train to Paris and, although Adolphe – who was then sixteen – wanted to walk to the border, the family recognised that his younger sister Anne-Marie, who was only twelve, was too young for such a trek. It was decided that Renia and Anne-Marie would stay in Brussels, while Sam and Ralph would go ahead and make the journey to Paris.  However, along the way Sam decided to change the plan and went with his son to <a href="/wiki/Ostend" title="Ostend">Ostend</a>, where they caught the last boat to Britain.

<p>In London, Miliband abandoned the name Adolphe due to its connection with Nazi leader <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and instead began calling himself Ralph. He and his father gained work in the <a href="/wiki/Chiswick" title="Chiswick">Chiswick</a> area removing furniture from houses bombed in <a href="/wiki/The_Blitz" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a> and, after six weeks, were able to send news to Renia and Anne-Marie that they were in London. Discovering that the Jews of Belgium were being rounded up by the Nazis, to be sent to extermination camps in <a href="/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>, Renia and Anne-Marie managed to escape to a rural farm, where they were hidden by a French family until after the end of the war, when they were reunited with Sam and Ralph.<sup id="cite_ref-McSmith_4-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-McSmith-4">[4]</a></sup> However, several of Miliband's relatives and his best friend, Maurice Tan, were killed in the Holocaust.<sup id="cite_ref-ODNB_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ODNB-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>To his dismay, the teenage Miliband came across <a href="/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a> in London. In a diary entry made shortly after he arrived in Britain, he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>The Englishman is a rabid nationalist. They are perhaps the most nationalist people in the world ... When you hear the English talk of this war you sometimes almost want them to lose it to show them how things are. They have the greatest contempt for the continent in general and for the French in particular. They didn't like the French before the defeat ... Since the defeat, they have the greatest contempt for the French Army ... England first. This slogan is taken for granted by the English people as a whole. To lose their <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">empire</a> would be the worst possible humiliation.<sup id="cite_ref-Simkin_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Simkin-5">[5]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Learning to speak English, Ralph gained a place at <a href="/wiki/Acton_Technical_College" title="Acton Technical College" class="mw-redirect">Acton Technical College</a> (now <a href="/wiki/Brunel_University" title="Brunel University" class="mw-redirect">Brunel University</a>)<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> in west London with the help of the <a href="/wiki/League_of_Nations" title="League of Nations">League of Nations</a>' <a href="/wiki/Organisation_of_the_League_of_Nations#Commission_for_Refugees" title="Organisation of the League of Nations">Commission for Refugees</a> in January 1941.

</p><p>Miliband volunteered to be sent to Belgium to assist the <a href="/wiki/Belgian_Resistance" title="Belgian Resistance">resistance movement</a>, and passed his medical in January 1942, but as a Polish national he was not allowed to join until the <a href="/wiki/Polish_government-in-exile" title="Polish government-in-exile">Polish authorities</a> gave consent.

<p>Miliband joined the Labour Party in 1951, and was a reluctant <a href="/wiki/Bevanite" title="Bevanite" class="mw-redirect">Bevanite</a> in the early 1950s.  He joined the British <a href="/wiki/New_Left" title="New Left">New Left</a>, alongside the likes of <a href="/wiki/E._P._Thompson" title="E. P. Thompson">E. P.

</p><p>Miliband published his first book, <i>Parliamentary Socialism</i>, in 1961, which examined the role that the Labour Party played in British politics and society from a Marxist position, finding it wanting for a lack of radicalism.<sup id="cite_ref-Telobit_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Telobit-7">[7]</a></sup> Paul Blackledge would later claim that it was "arguably Miliband's finest work".<sup id="cite_ref-Blackledge_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blackledge-1">[1]</a></sup> He ended his membership of the Labour Party in the mid-1960s, and subsequently remained independent of formal political affiliation.<sup id="cite_ref-Ali_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Ali-3">[3]</a></sup> He began arguing that socialists in Britain had to start working towards building a viable alternative that would be genuinely revolutionary socialist in its positions.<sup id="cite_ref-Blackledge_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Blackledge-1">[1]</a></sup>

</p><p>Miliband was passionately opposed to American involvement in the <a href="/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>.  In 1967 he wrote in the <i>Socialist Register</i> that "the US has over...a period of years been engaged...in the wholesale slaughter of men, women and children, the maiming of many more" and that the United States' "catalogue of horrors" against the <a href="/wiki/Vietnamese_people" title="Vietnamese people">Vietnamese people</a> was being done "in the name of an enormous lie". In the same article, he attacked <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> for his defence of the United States' action in Vietnam, describing it as being the "most shameful chapter in the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Labour_Party" title="History of the Labour Party" class="mw-redirect">history of the Labour Party</a>".
