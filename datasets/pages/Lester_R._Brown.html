<p>Brown was born and raised on a farm without running water or electricity in <a href="/wiki/Bridgeton,_New_Jersey" title="Bridgeton, New Jersey">Bridgeton</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> near the <a href="/wiki/Delaware_River" title="Delaware River">Delaware River</a>. He learned to read early and was a voracious reader. He was fascinated by World War II and would borrow day-old papers from the next door farm to follow it. He especially enjoyed reading biographies including those of America’s <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers" title="Founding Fathers" class="mw-redirect">founding fathers</a> and others such as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington Carver, and Marie Curie. From his earliest years, he worked on the farm, milking cows, pulling weeds, and cleaning the stable. An enterprising youth, he involved his younger brother, Carl, in various businesses, such as growing pheasants and chickens for sale. In 1951, they started a tomato growing business, which eventually grew  to become one of New Jersey's largest, with sales of over 1,520,000 pounds (690,000&#160;kg) a year. He later said, "farming is all I ever wanted to do with all my life. You have to know soils, weather, <a href="/wiki/Plant_pathology" title="Plant pathology">plant pathology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Entomology" title="Entomology">entomology</a>, management, even politics. It's the ideal interdisciplinary profession."<sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Shortly after earning a degree in <a href="/wiki/Agricultural_science" title="Agricultural science">agricultural science</a> from <a href="/wiki/Rutgers_University" title="Rutgers University">Rutgers University</a> in 1955, through the International Farm Youth Exchange Program, he spent six months living in rural <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a> where he became intimately familiar with food and population issues. "His experiences in Indian villages changed his life," wrote biographer David De Leon. "Although he went back to growing tomatoes when he returned to the United States, this no longer seemed like exciting work." <sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Brown decided that to work on the global food issue, he would need to work for the U.S. <a href="/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" title="Department of Agriculture" class="mw-redirect">Department of Agriculture</a>'s (USDA) <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Agricultural_Service" title="Foreign Agricultural Service">Foreign Agricultural Service</a> (FAS).<sup id="cite_ref-EPI_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-EPI-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> He learned that before they would hire him, he needed to have a degree in agricultural economics. Brown took nine months to earn a master's degree in agricultural economics from the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park" title="University of Maryland, College Park">University of Maryland</a> and in 1959 joined FAS as an international agricultural analyst in the Asia branch. A year or so later, he took a nine-month leave to earn a <a href="/wiki/Master_of_Public_Administration" title="Master of Public Administration">master of public administration</a> from the Harvard Graduate School of Public Administration which was later to become the <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_School_of_Government" title="John F. Kennedy School of Government">John F. Kennedy School of Government</a>.
</p><p>In 1963, just four years later, he published Man, Land and Food, the first comprehensive projection of world food, population, and land resources to the end of the century. The study was a cover story in January 6, 1963 issue of U.S. News &amp; World Report where it came to the attention of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture" title="United States Secretary of Agriculture">Secretary of Agriculture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orville_Freeman" title="Orville Freeman">Orville Freeman</a>. Freeman appreciated Brown’s bold analysis and offered him a job on his staff, saying "you sketched the problems. Now you have to do something about them." <sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  He was soon elevated to being the resident specialist on global issues. In this capacity, he advised the secretary of agriculture on his overseas agricultural policies. He also headed <a href="/wiki/USDA" title="USDA" class="mw-redirect">USDA</a>'s  <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Agricultural_Service#FAS.27_Return_to_International_Development_and_National_Security" title="Foreign Agricultural Service">International Agricultural Development Service</a> from 1966 to 1969. His primary job was to "increase food production in underdeveloped countries." <sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In early 1969, he left government to help establish the Overseas Development Council. He also became an enthusiastic believer in the promise of a <a href="/wiki/Green_Revolution" title="Green Revolution">Green Revolution</a>, with the hope of using better seeds and cultivation methods to help solve global problems of poverty and hunger. In his opinion, "this technology was the most crucial historical event since the steam engine."<sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> In subsequent years, however, he realized that rapid population growth in undeveloped countries was overwhelming the gains in increased food production.<sup id="cite_ref-SciAm_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SciAm-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In 1974, with support of a $500,000 grant from the <a href="/wiki/Rockefeller_Brothers_Fund" title="Rockefeller Brothers Fund">Rockefeller Brothers Fund</a>, Brown founded the <a href="/wiki/Worldwatch_Institute" title="Worldwatch Institute">Worldwatch Institute</a>, the first research institute devoted to the analysis of global environmental issues. While there he launched the Worldwatch Papers, the annual <a href="/wiki/State_of_the_World_(book_series)" title="State of the World (book series)">State of the World</a> reports, World Watch magazine, a second annual entitled <i>Vital Signs: The Trends That are Shaping Our Future</i>, and the Environmental Alert book series. According to De Leon, "he gathered a staff of young idealists just out of college. They were expected to be 'professional generalists,' rather than narrow specialists with advanced degrees."<sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The institute eventually became noted for being an independent and respected <a href="/wiki/Think_tank" title="Think tank">think tank</a> focusing on environmental issues and also a storehouse for a large amount of environmental information.  Their goal is to educate the public and government about environmental problems and to recommend actions. The institute has refused to become a lobbying organization, with Brown saying, "the world is filled with specialists who dig deep burrows into the earth and bring up these nuggets of insight, but there's no one up on top pulling it all together. That's our job."<sup id="cite_ref-DeLeon_9-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-DeLeon-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> As a result, he has been described as "one of the world's most influential thinkers" and was granted a $250,000 "genius award" by the <a href="/wiki/MacArthur_Foundation" title="MacArthur Foundation" class="mw-redirect">MacArthur Foundation</a> in 1986.
</p><p>In 2001, he left Worldwatch Institute to establish the <a href="/wiki/Earth_Policy_Institute" title="Earth Policy Institute">Earth Policy Institute</a>, devoted to providing a plan to save civilization. At the Institute, his years of working on global issues through an interdisciplinary lens has enabled him to identify trends those working in specialized areas might not see. They have also allowed him to consider global solutions to the many environmental concerns of today. Some of the more important works Brown has written at the Institute include <i>World on the Edge: How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse</i> (2011), <i>Eco-Economy: Building an Economy for the Earth</i> (2001), and the <i>Plan B</i> series. His most recent book is <i>The Great Transition: Shifting from Fossil Fuels to Solar and Wind Energy</i> (2015) co-authored with Janet Larsen, J. Matthew Roney, and Emily E. Adams.
</p><p>On June 30, 2015, he officially retired and closed the Earth Policy Institute. His legacies will live on through a Lester R. Brown Reading Room at Rutgers University (his alma mater). The room will house the collection of his books along with their translations, honorary degrees, and awards. His electronic collection of presentations, radio and television interviews, and documentaries in which he is featured will be accessioned into the Rutgers University library system. Rutgers is also hosting the Earth Policy Institute's website so that the information remains available.
</p><p>The Library of Congress is receiving his personal papers from his early years, through his career spanning the United States Department of Agriculture, the Overseas Development Council, Worldwatch Institute, and the Earth Policy Institute.

<p>In this book, published in 1995, Brown highlights the pressure on world resources as more countries, especially China, become developed. He writes, "To feed its 1.2 billion people, China may soon have to import so much grain that this action could trigger unprecedented rises in world food prices."
</p><p>In February 2014, he updated that forecast stating that China had since become a leading world grain importer, "set to buy a staggering 22 million tons" in the 2013-2014 trade year and their grain use climbing by 17 million tons per year.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">&#91;14&#93;</a></sup>

<p>This book, published in 2004, is a more recent description of "the ways in which human demands are outstripping the earth's natural capacities, and how the resulting environmental damage is undermining food production on a global scale.   He documents that the decrease of crop production is due to <a href="/wiki/Global_warming" title="Global warming">global warming</a>, water shortages, decreasing <a href="/wiki/Cropland" title="Cropland" class="mw-redirect">cropland</a> in developing countries like China, and <a href="/wiki/Population_growth" title="Population growth">population growth</a> that is still increasing world population by 76 million each year.

<p>This book, published in 2009, continues  the themes of his earlier books, and  is written as a final warning call for the leaders of the world to begin "mobilizing to save civilization" and stresses even more that time is of the essence.
