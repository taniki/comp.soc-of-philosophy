<p>As with many medieval figures, little is known about Hugh's early life. He was probably born in the 1090s. His homeland may have been Lorraine, Ypres in Flanders, or the <a href="/wiki/Duchy_of_Saxony" title="Duchy of Saxony">Duchy of Saxony</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> Some sources say that his birth occurred in the <a href="/wiki/Harz_(district)" title="Harz (district)">Harz district</a>, being the eldest son of <a href="/wiki/House_of_Regenstein" title="House of Regenstein">Baron Conrad</a> of <a href="/wiki/Blankenburg_(Harz)" title="Blankenburg (Harz)">Blankenburg</a>. Over the protests of his family, he entered the <a href="/wiki/Priory" title="Priory">Priory</a> of <a href="/wiki/Pancras_of_Rome" title="Pancras of Rome">St. Pancras</a>, a community of <a href="/wiki/Canons_regular" title="Canons regular" class="mw-redirect">canons regular</a>, where he had studied, located at Hamerleve, near <a href="/wiki/Halberstadt" title="Halberstadt">Halberstadt</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-CE_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CE-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Due to civil unrest shortly after his entry to the priory, Hugh's uncle, <a href="/wiki/Reinhard_of_Blankenburg" title="Reinhard of Blankenburg">Reinhard of Blankenburg</a>, who was the local <a href="/wiki/Bishop" title="Bishop">bishop</a>, advised him to transfer to the <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_Saint_Victor,_Paris" title="Abbey of Saint Victor, Paris" class="mw-redirect">Abbey of Saint Victor in Paris</a>, where he himself had studied theology.

<p>Hugh wrote many works from the 1120s until his death (Migne, <i>Patrologia Latina</i> contains 46 works by Hugh, and this is not a full collection), including works of theology (both treatises and <i>sententiae</i>), commentaries (mostly on the Bible but also including one of pseudo-Dionysius' <i>Celestial Hierarchies</i>), mysticism, philosophy and the arts, and a number of letters and sermons.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Hugh was influenced by many people, but chiefly by <a href="/wiki/Saint_Augustine" title="Saint Augustine" class="mw-redirect">Saint Augustine</a>, especially in holding that the arts and philosophy can serve theology.
</p><p>Hugh's most significant works include:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>De sacramentis christianae fidei</i> (<i>On the Mysteries of the Christian Faith</i>/<i>On the Sacraments of the Christian Faith</i>)<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> It is Hugh's most celebrated masterpiece and presents the bulk of Hugh's thoughts on theological and mystical ideas, ranging from God and angels to natural laws.</li>
<li> <i>Didascalicon de studio legendi</i> (<i>Didascalion, or, On the Study of Reading</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> The <i>Didascalicon</i> is written as an introductory guide to Christianity, reflecting Hugh's desire to be an elementary teacher of Christianity.  The <i>Didascalicon</i> reveals a very philosophical side of Hugh, in which he reflects on what basic elements of learning a Christian should focus on. One of the chapters is on music and deals with <a href="/wiki/Musica_universalis" title="Musica universalis">the three kinds of music</a> in a manner strongly indebted to <a href="/wiki/Boethius" title="Boethius">Boethius</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li> <i>In Hierarchiam celestem commentaria</i> (<i>Commentary on the Celestial Hierarchy</i>), a commentary on the work by <a href="/wiki/Pseudo-Dionysius" title="Pseudo-Dionysius" class="mw-redirect">pseudo-Dionysius</a>, perhaps begun around 1125.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> After <a href="/wiki/John_Scotus_Eriugena" title="John Scotus Eriugena">Eriugena</a>'s translation of Dionysius in the ninth century, there is almost no interest shown in Dionysius until Hugh's commentary.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> It is possible that Hugh may have decided to produce the commentary (which perhaps originated in lectures to students) because of the continuing (incorrect) belief that the patron saint of the Abbey of Saint Denis, Saint <a href="/wiki/Denis" title="Denis">Denis</a>, was to be identified with pseudo-Dionysius. Dionysian thought did not form an important influence on the rest of Hugh's work. Hugh's commentary, however, became a major part of the twelfth and thirteenth-century surge in interest in Dionysius; his and Eriugena's commentaries were often attached to the Dionysian corpus in manuscripts, such that his thought had great influence on later interpretation of Dionysius by <a href="/wiki/Richard_of_St_Victor" title="Richard of St Victor" class="mw-redirect">Richard of St Victor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Gallus" title="Thomas Gallus">Thomas Gallus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hugh_of_Balma" title="Hugh of Balma">Hugh of Balma</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bonaventure" title="Bonaventure">Bonaventure</a> and others.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>Other works by Hugh of St Victor include:
</p>
<ul><li><i>In Salomonis Ecclesiasten</i> (<i>Commentary on Ecclesiastes</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>In 1125-30, Hugh wrote three treatises structured around Noah's ark: <i>De arca Noe morali</i> (<i>Noah's Moral Ark</i>/<i>On the Moral Interpretation of the Ark of Noah</i>), <i>De arca Noe mystica</i> (<i>Noah's Mystical Ark</i>/<i>On the Mystic Interpretation of the Ark of Noah</i>), and <i>De vanitate mundi</i> (<i>The World's Vanity</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> <i>De arca Noe morali</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/De_arca_Noe_mystica" title="De arca Noe mystica" class="mw-redirect">De arca Noe mystica</a></i> reflect Hugh's fascination with both mysticism and the book of Genesis.</li>

<li><i>On Contemplation and its Forms</i>. This is one of the earliest works devoted to contemplation.

<li><i>On Sacred Scripture and its Authors</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li>Various other treatises exist whose authorship by Hugh is uncertain. Six of these are reprinted, in Latin in Roger Baron, ed, <i>Hugues de Saint-Victor: Six Opuscules Spirituels</i>, <i>Sources chrétiennes</i> 155, (Paris, 1969). They are: <i>De meditatione</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">&#91;20&#93;</a></sup> <i>De verbo Dei</i>, <i>De substantia dilectionis</i>, <i>Quid vere diligendus est</i>, <i>De quinque septenis </i>,<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">&#91;21&#93;</a></sup> and <i>De septem donis Spiritus sancti</i><sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup></li>
<li><i>De anima</i> is a treatise of the soul: the text will be found in the edition of Hugh's works in the <i><a href="/wiki/Patrologia_Latina" title="Patrologia Latina">Patrologia Latina</a></i> of <a href="/wiki/J._P._Migne" title="J.

<p>Various other works were wrongly attributed to Hugh in later thought. One such particularly influential work was the <i>Exposition of the Rule of St Augustine</i>, now accepted to be from the Victorine school but not by Hugh of St Victor.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>A new edition of Hugh's works has been started.  The first publication is:
<i>Hugonis de Sancto Victore De sacramentis Christiane fidei</i>, ed. Rainer Berndt, Münster: Aschendorff, 2008.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Philosophy_and_theology">Philosophy and theology</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Hugh_of_Saint_Victor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Philosophy and theology">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>The early <i>Didascalicon</i> was an elementary, encyclopedic approach to God and Christ, in which Hugh avoided controversial subjects and focused on what he took to be commonplaces of Catholic Christianity. In it he outlined three types of philosophy or "science" [scientia] that can help mortals improve themselves and advance toward God: theoretical philosophy (theology, mathematics, physics) provides them with truth, practical philosophy (ethics, economics, politics) aids them in becoming virtuous and prudent, and "mechanical" or "illiberal" philosophy (e.g., carpentry, agriculture, medicine) yields physical benefits. A fourth philosophy, logic, is preparatory to the others and exists to ensure clear and proper conclusions in them. Hugh's deeply mystical bent did not prevent him from seeing philosophy as a useful tool for understanding the divine, or from using it to argue on behalf of faith.
</p><p>Hugh was heavily influenced by Augustine's exegesis of <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Genesis" title="Book of Genesis">Genesis</a>. Divine Wisdom was the archetypal form of creation.  The creation of the world in six days was a mystery for man to contemplate, perhaps even a <a href="/wiki/Sacrament" title="Sacrament">sacrament</a>. God's forming order from chaos to make the world was a message to humans to rise up from their own chaos of ignorance and become creatures of Wisdom and therefore beauty. This kind of mystical-ethical interpretation was typical for Hugh, who tended to find <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Genesis" title="Book of Genesis">Genesis</a> interesting for its moral lessons rather than as a literal account of events.
</p><p>Along with <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sacraments" title="Sacraments" class="mw-redirect">sacraments</a> were divine gifts that God gave man to redeem himself, though God could have used other means. Hugh separated everything along the lines of <i>opus creationis</i> and <i>opus restaurationis</i>. <i>Opus Creationis</i> was the works of the creation, referring to the works of man, while <i>opus restaurationis</i> was that which dealt with the reasons for God sending <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> and the consequences of that. Hugh believed that God did not have to send Jesus and that He had other options open to Him. Why he chose to send Jesus is a mystery we are to meditate on and is to be learned through revelation, with the aid of philosophy to facilitate understanding.

<p>Within the Abbey of St Victor, many scholars who followed him are often known as the 'School of St Victor'. Both Achard and Andrew of St Victor appear to have been direct disciples of Hugh.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>He was also an influence on the critic <a href="/wiki/Edward_Said" title="Edward Said">Edward Said</a>, who cited this passage from Hugh of St Victor in numerous published works:
</p>
<blockquote>It is therefore, a source of great virtue for the practiced mind to learn, bit by bit, first to change about in visible and transitory things, so that afterwards it may be able to leave them behind altogether. The person who finds his homeland sweet is a tender beginner; he to whom every soil is as his native one is already strong; but he is perfect to whom the entire world is as a foreign place. The tender soul has fixed his love on one spot in the world; the strong person has extended his love to all places; the perfect man has extinguished his.</blockquote>
