<p>Faber was born in 1814 at <a href="/wiki/Calverley" title="Calverley">Calverley</a>, then within the <a href="/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_England" title="Civil parishes in England">Parish</a> of Calverley in the <a href="/wiki/West_Riding_of_Yorkshire" title="West Riding of Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> where his grandfather, Thomas Faber, was the <a href="/wiki/Vicar_(Anglicanism)" title="Vicar (Anglicanism)">vicar</a>. His father served the local bishop of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> as his secretary.<sup id="cite_ref-OST_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OST-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Faber attended grammar school at <a href="/wiki/Bishop_Auckland" title="Bishop Auckland">Bishop Auckland</a> in <a href="/wiki/County_Durham" title="County Durham">County Durham</a> for a short time, but a large portion of his boyhood was spent in <a href="/wiki/Westmorland" title="Westmorland">Westmorland</a>. He afterwards attended the <a href="/wiki/Harrow_School" title="Harrow School">Harrow School</a> for five years, followed by enrollment in 1832 at <a href="/wiki/Balliol_College,_Oxford" title="Balliol College, Oxford">Balliol College</a> at the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University" class="mw-redirect">University of Oxford</a>. In 1834, he obtained a scholarship at the <a href="/wiki/University_College,_Oxford" title="University College, Oxford">University College</a>, from which he graduated. In 1836 he won the <a href="/wiki/Newdigate_Prize" title="Newdigate Prize">Newdigate Prize</a> for a poem on "The Knights of St John," which elicited special praise from <a href="/wiki/John_Keble" title="John Keble">John Keble</a>. Among his college friends were <a href="/wiki/Arthur_Penrhyn_Stanley" title="Arthur Penrhyn Stanley" class="mw-redirect">Arthur Penrhyn Stanley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Roundell_Palmer,_1st_Earl_of_Selborne" title="Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne">Roundell Palmer, 1st Earl of Selborne</a>. After graduation he was elected a <a href="/wiki/Fellow#Oxford.2C_Cambridge_and_Dublin" title="Fellow">fellow</a> of the college.
</p><p>Faber's family was of <a href="/wiki/Huguenot" title="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> descent, and <a href="/wiki/Calvinism" title="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> beliefs were strongly held by them. When Faber had come to Oxford, he was exposed to the <a href="/wiki/Anglo-Catholicism" title="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholic</a> preaching of the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_Movement" title="Oxford Movement">Oxford Movement</a> which was beginning to develop in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. One of its most prominent proponents was the popular preacher <a href="/wiki/John_Henry_Newman" title="John Henry Newman">John Henry Newman</a>, vicar of the <a href="/wiki/University_Church_of_St_Mary_the_Virgin" title="University Church of St Mary the Virgin">University Church of St Mary the Virgin</a>. Faber struggled with these divergent forms of Christian beliefs and life. In order to relieve his tension, he would take long vacations in the <a href="/wiki/Lake_District" title="Lake District">Lake District</a>, where he would write poetry. There he was befriended by another poet, <a href="/wiki/William_Wordsworth" title="William Wordsworth">William Wordsworth</a>. He finally abandoned the Calvinistic views of his youth and became an enthusiastic follower of Newman.<sup id="cite_ref-OST_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OST-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Faber was <a href="/wiki/Holy_Orders" title="Holy Orders" class="mw-redirect">ordained</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a> in 1839, after which he spent time supporting himself as a tutor. In 1841 a travelling tutorship took him to the continent; on his return he published a book called <i>Sights and Thoughts in Foreign Churches and among Foreign Peoples</i> (London, 1842), with a dedication to his friend, the poet Wordsworth.<sup id="cite_ref-OST_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OST-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1843, Faber accepted the position of  <a href="/wiki/Rector_(ecclesiastical)" title="Rector (ecclesiastical)">rector</a> at a church in <a href="/wiki/Elton,_Cambridgeshire" title="Elton, Cambridgeshire">Elton</a>, then in <a href="/wiki/Huntingdonshire" title="Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</a> but now in <a href="/wiki/Cambridgeshire" title="Cambridgeshire">Cambridgeshire</a>. His first act was to go to Rome to learn how best to carry out his pastoral charge. Faber introduced the Catholic practices of celebrating <a href="/wiki/Calendar_of_saints" title="Calendar of saints">feast days</a>, <a href="/wiki/Confession_(religion)" title="Confession (religion)">confession</a> and the devotion of the <a href="/wiki/Sacred_Heart" title="Sacred Heart">Sacred Heart</a> to the congregation. However, there was a strong <a href="/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> presence in the parish and the Dissidents packed his church each Sunday in an attempt to challenge the Roman Catholic direction he was taking the congregation in. Many of his parishioners were reputed to be living in de facto relationships and the village was notorious for its double standards. He developed the thought of following a monastic way of life and was joined by several men with whom he formed a small community at the rectory.<sup id="cite_ref-OST_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OST-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Faber caused a small furore through his publication of a <i>Life of St. <a href="/wiki/Wilfrid" title="Wilfrid">Wilfrid</a></i>, in which he supported the claim of <a href="/wiki/Primacy_of_the_Bishop_of_Rome" title="Primacy of the Bishop of Rome">primacy</a> by the pope. Nonetheless he was accepted by the people of the parish.<sup id="cite_ref-OST_2-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OST-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="A_Catholic_priest">A Catholic priest</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Frederick_William_Faber&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: A Catholic priest">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Few people were surprised though when, after prolonged mental struggle, Faber left Elton to follow his hero Newman and join the Catholic Church, into which he was received in November 1845 by Bishop <a href="/wiki/William_Wareing" title="William Wareing">William Wareing</a> of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Northampton" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton">Northampton</a>. He was accompanied in this step by eleven men of the small community which had formed around him in Elton. They settled in Birmingham, where they informally organized themselves in a religious community, calling themselves the Brothers of the Will of God.<sup id="cite_ref-SC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SC-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Faber and his small religious community were encouraged in their venture by the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Shrewsbury" title="Earl of Shrewsbury">Earl of Shrewsbury</a>, who gave them the use of <a href="/wiki/Cotton_College" title="Cotton College">Cotton Hall</a> in <a href="/wiki/Staffordshire" title="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. Within weeks they had begun construction on a new Church of St. Wilfrid, their patron saint, designed by the noted church architect, <a href="/wiki/Augustus_Welby_Northmore_Pugin" title="Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin" class="mw-redirect">Pugin</a>, as well as on a school for the local children. All of this was for a region which had no other Catholics at that point, other than the household of the Earl. The exertions took their toll on Faber, who became so ill that he was not expected to live and was given the <a href="/wiki/Last_Rites" title="Last Rites" class="mw-redirect">Last Rites</a> of the Church. He recovered, however, and was ordained a Catholic priest, celebrating his <a href="/wiki/First_Mass" title="First Mass">First Mass</a> on 4 April 1847. In the course of his illness Faber had developed a strong devotion to the <a href="/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus" title="Mary, mother of Jesus" class="mw-redirect">Blessed Mother</a>. Prompted by this devotion, he translated St. <a href="/wiki/Louis_de_Montfort" title="Louis de Montfort">Louis de Montfort</a>'s classic work, <i><a href="/wiki/True_Devotion_to_Mary" title="True Devotion to Mary">True Devotion to Mary</a></i>, into English.<sup id="cite_ref-SC_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SC-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Oratory">The Oratory</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Frederick_William_Faber&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: The Oratory">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Along with Newman, Faber felt drawn to the way of life of the <a href="/wiki/Oratory_of_St_Philip_Neri" title="Oratory of St Philip Neri" class="mw-redirect">Oratory of St Philip Neri</a>, with its  decentralized authority and greater freedom of life than in <a href="/wiki/Religious_institute" title="Religious institute" class="mw-redirect">religious institutes</a>. His interest was heightened when he learned that Newman himself had become an Oratorian while in Italy. Faber envisioned having his community at Cotton Hall form a new community of the Oratory, with Newman as Superior. However, this could not happen at  Cotton Hall since the Oratorian rules required that they be an urban community.<sup id="cite_ref-OST_2-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-OST-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>The Earl, who had handsomely financed the construction of a new parish for the community, felt betrayed by such a quick departure. Additionally, the Wilfridians, as the Brothers were called, wished to wear a traditional religious habit, upsetting the old Catholic families who had survived centuries of persecution by keeping a low profile. Newman thus proposed that Faber's community settle somewhere other than Birmingham, and suggested London as the best option. Thus in 1849 a community of the Oratory was established in London in William IV Street.<sup id="cite_ref-Bowden_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Bowden-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>On 11 October 1850, the feast of St. Wilfrid, the community in London was established as autonomous, and Faber was elected its first <a href="/wiki/Provost_(religion)" title="Provost (religion)">provost</a>, an office he held until his death. He took ill again, however, almost immediately, and was ordered by his physicians to travel to a warmer climate. He attempted a trip to the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Land" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a> but had to turn back, and instead toured Malta and Italy. The community still lacked a permanent home, and in September 1852 a location was chosen at <a href="/wiki/Brompton_Oratory" title="Brompton Oratory">Brompton</a>. The Oratorians proceeded with construction despite public protests at their presence.<sup id="cite_ref-SC_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SC-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Faber had never enjoyed good health. He had suffered from illness for years, developing what was eventually diagnosed as <a href="/wiki/Bright%27s_Disease" title="Bright's Disease" class="mw-redirect">Bright's Disease</a>, which was to prove fatal. In spite of his weak health, much work was crowded into those years. He published a number of theological works, and edited the <i>Oratorian Lives of the Saints</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Faber died in 1863 and was buried in the Oratorian cemetery in <a href="/wiki/Rednal" title="Rednal">Rednal</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/West_Midlands_(county)" title="West Midlands (county)">West Midlands</a>.
</p><p>Father Faber was the great-uncle of <a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Faber" title="Geoffrey Faber">Geoffrey Faber</a>, co-founder of the publishing house "Faber and Gwyer" which later became "<a href="/wiki/Faber_and_Faber" title="Faber and Faber">Faber and Faber</a>", a major publisher of both literary and religious works.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
</p>
<a href="/wiki/A._W._Tozer" title="A. W. Tozer">A. W. Tozer</a>, a lay-minister, quoted Faber's hymns often in his writings. He compared Spinoza and Faber in his book <i>The Pursuit of God</i> in this way. <blockquote class="templatequote">Spinoza wrote of the intellectual love of God, and he had a measure of truth there; but the highest love of God is not intellectual, it is spiritual. God is spirit and only the spirit of man can know Him really. In the deep spirit of a man the fire must glow or his love is not the true love of God. The great of the Kingdom have been those who loved God more than others did. We all know who they have been and gladly pay tribute to the depths and sincerity of their devotion. We have but to pause for a moment and their names come trooping past us smelling of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces. Frederick Faber was one whose soul panted after God as the roe pants after the water brook, and the measure in which God revealed Himself to his seeking heart set the good man's whole life afire with a burning adoration rivaling that of the seraphim before the throne. His love for God extended to the three Persons of the Godhead equally, yet he seemed to feel for each One a special kind of love reserved for Him alone. <i>The Pursuit of God,</i> p. 40

<p>Those hymns are also used in <a href="/wiki/Protestant" title="Protestant" class="mw-redirect">Protestant</a> collections as well. Faber was a supporter of congregational singing and wrote his hymns in an age when English Catholics did not necessarily feel comfortable singing the hymns of their Protestant neighbors. So Faber, as a Catholic, expanded their hymns suitable for congregational singing and encouraged the practice.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
