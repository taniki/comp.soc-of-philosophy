<p>Campbell was born on 25 December 1719 in <a href="/wiki/Aberdeen" title="Aberdeen">Aberdeen</a> (it is unlikely that there was much significance given to his birth date, since Scottish <a href="/wiki/Calvinist" title="Calvinist" class="mw-redirect">Calvinists</a>, such as Campbell's father, Rev. Colin Campbell, despised both <a href="/wiki/Popish" title="Popish" class="mw-redirect">popish</a> rituals and holidays). At the age of fifteen, Campbell attended <a href="/wiki/Marischal_College" title="Marischal College">Marischal College</a> where he studied <a href="/wiki/Logic" title="Logic">logic</a>, metaphysics, pneumatology (philosophy of mind and/or spirit), ethics, and <a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" title="Natural philosophy">natural philosophy</a>. After graduating with his M.A. in 1738, Campbell decided to study law and served as an apprentice to a <a href="/wiki/Writer_to_the_Signet" title="Writer to the Signet" class="mw-redirect">writer to the Signet</a> in Edinburgh. He began gravitating towards theology after attending lectures at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>. After serving out his term as an apprentice, he returned to Aberdeen and enrolled at both <a href="/wiki/King%27s_College,_Aberdeen" title="King's College, Aberdeen">King's</a> and <a href="/wiki/Marischal_College" title="Marischal College">Marischal Colleges</a>, <a href="/wiki/University_of_Aberdeen" title="University of Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> as a student of divinity. Because of the tumultuous political landscape in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Jacobite_rising" title="Jacobite rising" class="mw-redirect">Jacobite rising</a>), Campbell's divinity examinations were delayed until 1746 when he received his license to preach. Within two years, he received ordination at the parish of <a href="/wiki/Banchory" title="Banchory">Banchory</a> Ternan.
</p><p>The origin of Campbell's scholarly career can be traced back to his years at the parish. He established himself as a <a href="/wiki/Scripture" title="Scripture" class="mw-redirect">scripture</a> critic, and lecturer of <a href="/wiki/Holy_writ" title="Holy writ" class="mw-redirect">holy writ</a>. Campbell began his lifelong ambition of translating the <a href="/wiki/Gospel" title="Gospel">gospels</a>, and around 1750, he composed the first two chapters of <i>The Philosophy of Rhetoric</i>. Campbell's growing reputation impressed the <a href="/wiki/Magistrate" title="Magistrate">magistrates</a> of the city of Aberdeen and he was offered a ministerial position in 1757. His return brought him to the core of the growing intellectual community in northeast <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. In 1759, Campbell was offered the position of <a href="/wiki/Principal_(university)" title="Principal (university)" class="mw-redirect">principal</a> at Marischal College and he fully immersed himself in university affairs.
</p><p>During his time at Marischal, Campbell was a founding member of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Aberdeen_Philosophical_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Aberdeen Philosophical Society (page does not exist)">Aberdeen Philosophical Society</a> along with philosopher <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Reid" title="Thomas Reid">Thomas Reid</a>, <a href="/wiki/John_Gregory_(moralist)" title="John Gregory (moralist)">John Gregory</a> (mediciner), <a href="/w/index.php?title=David_Skene&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="David Skene (page does not exist)">David Skene</a>, <a href="/wiki/Walking_Stewart" title="Walking Stewart">John Stewart</a> and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Robert_Trail&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Robert Trail (page does not exist)">Robert Trail</a>. Many members of the Society, including Reid, Campbell, and Gregory, were great admirers of <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, so the group's aim directed toward the exploration of the sciences of the mind. The Aberdeen Philosophical Society is most often remembered for its philosophical publications, notably: Reid's <i>Inquiry into the Human mind, on the Principles of Common Sense</i> (1764), <a href="/wiki/James_Beattie_(writer)" title="James Beattie (writer)" class="mw-redirect">James Beattie</a>'s <i>Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth</i> (1770), and <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Gerard" title="Alexander Gerard">Alexander Gerard</a>' <i>Essay on Genius</i>. Campbell's work was very much influenced by the group's members. <i>The Philosophy of Rhetoric</i> was originally read in discourses before this Society. Campbell's emphasis on the trustworthiness of the senses and his exploration of tendencies basic to human nature have been attributed to the influence of his colleague in the society, the <a href="/wiki/Common_sense" title="Common sense">common sense</a> philosopher, Thomas Reid.
</p><p>Campbell's first major publication, <i>A Dissertation in Miracles</i> (1762), was directed against <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>'s attack on miracles in <i><a href="/wiki/An_Enquiry_concerning_Human_Understanding" title="An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding" class="mw-redirect">An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</a></i>. Campbell was influenced by Hume, but took particular issue with his philosophical strictures. Even though both were in complete opposition over almost every point of philosophy, Campbell and Hume shared a mutual respect. Thanks in part to the success of <i>Miracles</i>, Campbell became a Professor of Divinity at Marischal in 1770. He lectured to students to prepare them for the demands of the ministry, both practical and spiritual. Campbell gave lectures on <a href="/wiki/Church_history" title="Church history">Church history</a>, later published as <i>Lectures on Ecclesiastical History</i>, and on pastoral character and preaching, later published as <i>Lectures on Pulpit Eloquence</i>. After completing <i>The Philosophy of Rhetoric</i> (1776), Campbell published several sermons and finished his lifelong ambition, <i>The Four Gospels, Translated from the Greek</i> (1789).
</p><p>In December 1793 he was a Founder Member of the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh" title="Royal Society of Edinburgh">Royal Society of Edinburgh</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Campbell continued lecturing until ill health forced him into retirement in 1795 and he died on 6 April 1796. He is buried in St Nicholas Churchyard in Aberdeen.

<p>While Campbell's literary life was dominated by <a href="/wiki/Pedagogy" title="Pedagogy">pedagogical</a> and <a href="/wiki/Minister_of_religion" title="Minister of religion" class="mw-redirect">pastoral</a> concerns, it is apparent that his mind was tempered by the values of the Enlightenment. Campbell believed that the Enlightenment was the ally to a <a href="/wiki/Moderate_Party_(Scotland)" title="Moderate Party (Scotland)">moderate</a>, rational, and practical Christianity, rather than a threat. His faith required that his religious evidences to be complete while his enlightened thinking required faith to give it purpose.
</p><p>Throughout Campbell's literary career, he focused on enlightened concerns such as rhetoric, taste, and genius—perhaps a result of his time in the Aberdeen Philosophical Society. His attempt to align rhetoric within the sphere of psychology resulted from <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon" title="Francis Bacon">Francis Bacon</a>'s survey of the structure and purpose of knowledge. The Philosophy of Rhetoric illustrates the Baconian influence of <a href="/wiki/Inductive_reasoning" title="Inductive reasoning">inductive methodology</a> but also scientific investigation—two major concerns of the Enlightenment.
</p><p>As well, Campbell's appeal to natural evidences was a similarity in process shared by most of the great minds of the Enlightenment. This is seen throughout his writing, with particular emphasis on placing methodology before doctrine, critical inquiry before judgment, and his application of tolerance, moderation, and improvement.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Campbell_and_faculty_psychology">Campbell and faculty psychology</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=George_Campbell_(minister)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Campbell and faculty psychology">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>Campbell embraced the philosophical empiricism which <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">John Locke</a> established in <a href="/wiki/An_Essay_Concerning_Human_Understanding" title="An Essay Concerning Human Understanding">An Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a>. Following the example of Locke's humanistic sciences, Campbell set forth an analysis of rhetoric through the scope of mental faculties. He believed that a rhetoric grounded in <a href="/wiki/Empirical_knowledge" title="Empirical knowledge" class="mw-redirect">empiricism</a> would become efficient because of the incorporation of the <a href="/wiki/Cognition" title="Cognition">cognitive processes</a>. The human senses are the basis for the validity of belief; thus a <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric" title="Rhetoric">rhetorical theory</a> based in <a href="/wiki/Faculty_psychology" title="Faculty psychology">faculty psychology</a> would establish that <a href="/wiki/Rhetoric" title="Rhetoric">rhetoric</a> is capable of making a reader experience a concept with the same "vivacity" and automaticity as that of the senses.
</p><p>Campbell, like most theorists of the Enlightenment, believed in a <a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" title="Natural philosophy">universal human nature</a>: the "general principles [of taste] are the same in every people".<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> He gives the example of <a href="/wiki/Trope_(linguistics)" title="Trope (linguistics)" class="mw-redirect">tropes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Figures_of_speech" title="Figures of speech" class="mw-redirect">figuration</a> which "are so far from being the inventions of art, that, on the contrary, they result from the original and essential principles of the human mind".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2007)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> This facet of human nature has remained constant throughout history so it must be universal trait. Based on premises similar to this, Campbell claimed that human beings act according to clear and obvious motives and rhetoric should be, in turn, directed towards similar operations of the mind.
</p><p>To persuade effectively, Campbell believed that the orator should adapt his or her discourse to the needs of the audience, for as he states: "whatever be the ultimate intention of the orator, to inform, to convince, to please, to move, or to persuade, still he must speak so as to be understood, or he speaks to no purpose".<a href="/w/index.php?title=Template:The_Philosophy_of_Rhetoric,_216,_Book_II,_Chapter_IV&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:The Philosophy of Rhetoric, 216, Book II, Chapter IV (page does not exist)">Template:The Philosophy of Rhetoric, 216, Book II, Chapter IV</a>  He classifies the needs of the audience into four different categories:
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Understanding: Elucidating a subject by explanation and proof</li>
<li>Imagination: Exciting admiration by style, resemblance, detail, and sublimity</li>
<li>Passions: Involving, motivating, associating images</li>
<li>Will: Persuading to action by combining argumentation with vivacity</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>The purpose of discourse is derived from the powers of the mind to which they appeal (understanding, imagination, passions, will), rather than the classical three, which are based on the public purpose of oration. The classical categories (see <a href="/wiki/Cicero" title="Cicero">Cicero</a> and <a href="/wiki/Quintilian" title="Quintilian">Quintilian</a>) are the demonstrative, to praise or blame; the deliberative, to advise or dissuade; and the forensic, to accuse or defend. In considering each of these, Campbell believes that not only understanding and memory of the audience must be taken into account, but the orator must as well provide particular attention at stimulating their passions. To incorporate this was as an obvious concern for Campbell, who believed that effective <a href="/wiki/Sermon" title="Sermon">preaching</a> must be measured by its effects on the audience.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Campbell_and_evidence">Campbell and evidence</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=George_Campbell_(minister)&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Campbell and evidence">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h3>
<p>To move an audience, Campbell believed that a rhetorician must appreciate the relationship between evidence and human nature. Campbell divided evidence into two major types: intuitive and deductive.
</p><p>Intuitive evidence is convincing by its mere appearance. Its effect on the power of judgment is "natural, original, and unaccountable",<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2007)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> which suggests that no other additional evidences can make it more compelling or effective.  Campbell subdivides intuitive evidence into three sources: <a href="/wiki/Abstraction" title="Abstraction">abstraction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Consciousness" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Common_sense" title="Common sense">common sense</a>. These are responsible for our understanding of <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">metaphysical, physical, and moral truths</a>.
</p><p>Deductive evidence, unlike intuitive, is not immediately perceived. It must be demonstrated either logically or factually since it is not derived by premises but with comparing ideas. Deductive evidence originates from one of two sources: demonstrative or moral. Demonstrative concerns itself with abstract and invariable relations of ideas; moral, on the other hand, is concerned only with matters of fact.

<p>Campbell believed that <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Syllogism" title="Syllogism">syllogistic method</a> is faulty for four reasons:
</p>

<li> Even in mathematics or as a method of presentation, it is not efficient or effective since its formal rules do not guarantee validity;</li>
<li> Even if it is only used as a method of reasoning, a syllogism is not very useful because it leads one to discover what is obvious from the first premise, because the syllogism will most likely assume the point in question;</li>
<li> Even if they will sometimes guard the mind against an oversight, syllogisms often also mislead and are hardly the most effective check against carelessness.</li></ol></dd></dl>

<p>In <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a>'s essay, <i><a href="/wiki/Of_Miracles" title="Of Miracles">Of Miracles</a></i>, he assesses the credibility of <a href="/wiki/Testimony" title="Testimony">testimony</a> for miracles, and claims that our acceptance of it is based on experience; thus when testimony goes against the evidence of experience, it is a likely reason to reject the testimony.
</p><p>In response, Campbell published <i>A Dissertation on Miracles</i> to refute Hume's essay. He believed that Hume misrepresented the importance of testimony in attaining knowledge. Our faith in the representation of others is an original component in <a href="/wiki/Human_nature" title="Human nature">human nature</a>. As proof, Campbell provides the example of children who readily accept the testimony of others. It is not until they get older and become sceptical that testimony is rejected; proof that our trust in witnesses precedes that of experience. For Campbell, the belief of testimony is part of <a href="/wiki/Human_nature" title="Human nature">human nature</a>, since it is an unlearned and automatic response. Testimony is thus closer to evidence from <a href="/wiki/Consciousness" title="Consciousness">consciousness</a> than that from experience.
</p><p>Campbell argues that the most important factor in determining the authenticity of testimony is the number of witnesses. Numerous witnesses and no evidence of collusion will supersede all other factors, since the likelihood of testimony outweighs that of Hume's formula for determining the balance of probabilities. According to Campbell, Hume is wrong to claim that testimony is a weakened type of evidence; it is capable of providing absolute certainty even with the most miraculous event.

<dl><dd>Campbell regarded this as the greatest work of his life: a 1,500 page translation of the <a href="/wiki/Four_Gospels" title="Four Gospels" class="mw-redirect">Four Gospels</a>. Along with the translation, it includes critical dissertations on the problems of translating and interpreting the ancient texts, as well as his observations on the translations themselves.</dd></dl>

<p>Campbell's <a href="/wiki/Sermon" title="Sermon">sermons</a> and lectures provide important insights into the structure of his thought and range of his scholarly activities.
</p>
<ul><li> "The Spirit of the Gospel: A Spirit neither of Superstition nor of Enthusiasm" (1771)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Campbell attempts to defend the character of Christ against attacks from the outside the church and against the dangers of misguided Christians within. He argues, against the critics of religion, that true Christianity is not characterised by fearful <a href="/wiki/Superstition" title="Superstition">superstition</a> or by merciless indoctrination.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> "The Nature, Extent, and Importance of Duty of Allegiance" (1777)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Argues that <a href="/wiki/Rebellion" title="Rebellion">rebellion</a> is unreasonable and without <a href="/wiki/Scripture" title="Scripture" class="mw-redirect">scriptural warrant</a>. True <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a> can only be found within the rule of law.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> "The Success of the First Publishers of the Gospel: A Proof of its Truth" (1777)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Campbell argues that the situation of the world, during the early years of Christianity, was so utterly inhospitable that Christianity's success can only be explained by supernatural means.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> "The Happy Influence of Religion on Civil Society" (1779)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Campbell argues that religion is necessary for civil order and happiness because it provides moral sanctions that political laws cannot.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> "An Address to the People of Scotland upon the Alarms that Have Been Raised in Regard to Popery" (1779)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Campbell demonstrates, from both scripture and reason, that persecution in all its forms is both wrong and ineffective. He refuted claims that <a href="/wiki/Catholicism" title="Catholicism">Catholics</a> threatened national security and sought to overrun Britain.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> <i>Lectures on Ecclesiastical History</i> (Posthumous, 1800)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>The first part of Campbell's divinity course at Marischal College; they are topical arguments designed to illustrate certain historical tendencies in the development of the church. The lectures focus on the growth and domination of the hierarchical form of ecclesiastical government. There was nothing particularly new in Campbell's analysis, except his use of <a href="/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychological</a> explanations.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> <i>Lectures on Systematic Theology and Pulpit Eloquence</i> (posthumous, 1807)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Campbell underlines a systematic <a href="/wiki/Methodology" title="Methodology">methodology</a> for studying scripture, the evidences of religion, and for forming a system of Christian morality. Their purpose was to prevent divinity students from accepting a fixed view of Christianity.</dd></dl>
<ul><li> <i>Lectures on the Pastoral Character</i> (Posthumous, 1811)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>Practical lectures which give advice to prospective ministers on particular <a href="/wiki/Virtue" title="Virtue">virtues</a> to cultivate and <a href="/wiki/Vice" title="Vice">vices</a> to avoid.</dd></dl>
