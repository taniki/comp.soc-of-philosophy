141 de legibus naturae book how individuals discover precepts natural law divine obligation lies behind

darwall p
106 writes cumberland follows hobbes attempting provide fully naturalistic account normative force obligation idea rational dictate although rejects hobbes's theory these derive entirely instrumental rationality
laws nature/natural laws laws nature defined immutably true propositions regulative voluntary actions choice good avoidance evil carry them obligation outward acts obedience even apart civil laws any considerations compacts constituting government
definition says will admitted parties
deny such laws exist will grant ought understood them
there thus common ground two opposing schools moralists join issue
question them such laws exist not? reasoning thus cumberland obviously forgot position maintained principal antagonist really
hobbes deny there laws nature laws antecedent government laws even sense eternal immutable
virtues means happiness seemed such laws
precede civil constitution merely perfects obligation practise them
expressly denied however carry them obligation outward acts obedience even apart civil laws any consideration compacts constituting governments
many besides hobbes must felt dissatisfied definition
ambiguous obscure
sense law nature proposition? expression constant relation among facts expression divine commandment? proposition never itself ultimate fact although may statement such fact
sense law nature immutably true proposition? because men everywhere accept act merely because everywhere ought accept act it? definition fact explains nothing
existence such laws may according cumberland established two ways
inquirer may start either effects causes
former method taken hugo grotius robert sharrock john selden
sought prove there universal truths entitled called laws nature concurrence testimonies many men peoples ages through generalizing operations certain active principles
cumberland admits method valid prefers other causes effects showing convincingly laws nature carry them divine obligation
shows these laws universal intended such man constituted order might
prosecution method expressly declines recourse calls short easy expedient platonists assumption innate ideas laws nature
thinks ill-advised build doctrines natural religion morality hypothesis many philosophers rejected proved against epicureans principal impugners existence laws nature
cannot assume says such ideas existed eternity divine mind must start data sense experience thence search nature things discover their laws
through nature rise nature's god
attributes known direct intuition
therefore held ground taken up cambridge platonists maintained against hobbes
sympathies however their side nothing diminish their chances success
even oppose doctrine innate ideas because looked friendly eye upon piety morality
granted might perhaps case ideas both born us afterwards impressed upon us without
ethical theory cumberland's ethical theory summed up principle universal benevolence source moral good
no action morally good does own nature contribute somewhat happiness men
cumberland's benevolence deliberately precise antithesis egoism hobbes
cumberland maintained whole-hearted pursuit good contributes good each brings personal happiness opposite process involves misery individuals including self
cumberland never appealed evidence history although believed law universal benevolence accepted nations generations abstains arguments founded revelation feeling indispensable establish principles moral right nature basis
method deduction propriety certain actions consideration character position rational agents universe
argues see nature framed avoid reject dangerous integrity constitution human race anomaly world end conservation best estate benevolence rational view creation alone accordant general plan various peculiarities man's body indicate made co-operate fellow men maintain society certain faculties mind show common good essentially connected perfection any pursuit private advantage
whole course reasoning proceeds pervaded principle final causes
utilitarianism may regarded founder english utilitarianism utilitarianism distinct known selfish system goes contrary extreme almost absorbing individual universal good
question foundation rectitude? replies greatest good universe rational beings
version utilitarianism
nor does look merely lower pleasures pleasures sense constituents good rises above them include especially tends perfect strengthen expand our true nature
existence extension our powers body mind held good their own sakes without respect enjoyment
cumberland's views point long abandoned utilitarians destroying homogeneity self-consistency their theory john stuart mill other writers reproduced them necessary defence against charges less serious even inconsistency
answer cumberland gives question whence comes our obligation observe laws nature? happiness flows obedience misery disobedience them mere results blind necessity expressions divine will
claims reward punishment natural law realitylogical consequences natural law because no there happen their own logical consequence action
either good bad
reward punishment reward punishment supplemented future retribution view sanctions laws nature sources our obligation obey them
other great ethical question how moral distinctions apprehended? replies means right reason
right reason means merely power rising general laws nature particular facts experience
no peculiar faculty distinctive function mind involves no original element cognition begins sense experience gradually generated wholly derivative
doctrine lies germ cumberland will found full flower hartley mackintosh later associationists
