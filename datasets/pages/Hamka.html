<p>Hamka was born on 17 February 1908 (<a href="/wiki/Islamic_calendar" title="Islamic calendar">Hijri Calendar</a>: 13th of Muharram 1362AH)in <a href="/wiki/Minangkabau_Highlands" title="Minangkabau Highlands">Minangkabau</a>, <a href="/wiki/West_Sumatra" title="West Sumatra">West Sumatra</a>, as the first child of seven brothers. He was raised in a family of devout <a href="/wiki/Muslim" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>. His father was <a href="/wiki/Abdul_Karim_Amrullah" title="Abdul Karim Amrullah">Abdul Karim Amrullah</a>, a clerical reformer of Islam in Minangkabau who was known as Haji Rasul, while his mother, Sitti Shafiyah, came from artists of Minangkabau descent. The father of Abdul Karim, Hamka's grandfather, namely <a href="/wiki/Muhammad_Amrullah" title="Muhammad Amrullah">Muhammad Amrullah</a> was known as a follower of cleric <a href="/w/index.php?title=Congregation_Naqsyabandiyah&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Congregation Naqsyabandiyah (page does not exist)">Congregation Naqsyabandiyah</a>.
</p><p>Prior to education in formal schools, Hamka lived with his grandmother in a house south of <a href="/wiki/Maninjau" title="Maninjau" class="mw-redirect">Maninjau</a>. When he was six years old, he moved with his father to Padang Panjang, West Sumatera. Following common tradition in Minang, as a child he studied the Quran and slept in a mosque which is near the place where he lives, because Minang boys did not have a place to sleep in the house. In the mosque, he studied the Quran and <i><a href="/wiki/Silat" title="Silat">silek</a></i>, while outside it, he likes to listen to <i>kaba</i>, the stories which are sung along with traditional Minangkabau music. Interaction with these storyteller artists gave him knowledge of the art of storytelling and word processing. Later, through his novels, Hamka often plucks vocabulary and Minang terms. Like the writer who was born in the realm of Minang, rhymes and proverbs adorn his works.

<p>In 1915, even after the age of seven, he enrolled in a village school (<i>Sekolah Rakyat</i>) and studied general science such as numeracy and literacy. At those times, as considered by Hamka himself, as one of the beautiful eras in his life. In the morning, he rushed off to school so that he can play before class started. Then after school, he would go play again with his friends, such as hide and seek, wrestling, chasing after one another, like the other kids his age played. Two years later, while still learning every morning at the village school, he also studied in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Diniyah_School&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Diniyah School (page does not exist)">Diniyah School</a> every afternoon. But since his father enrolled him in <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sumatera_Thawalib&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sumatera Thawalib (page does not exist)">Sumatera Thawalib</a> in 1918, he could no longer attend classes at the village school. He quit after graduating two classes. After that, he studied at the Diniyah School every morning, while in the afternoon and evening studying in Thawalib back at the mosque. Those are young Hamka's activities everyday, something which, as he admitted, not fun and curbed the freedom of his childhood.
</p><p>While studying in Thawalib, he was not considered as a smart child, he even often did not attend in a few days because he felt bored and chose to seek knowledge in his own way. He preferred to be in a library owned by his public teacher, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Zainuddin_Labay_El_Yunusy&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Zainuddin Labay El Yunusy (page does not exist)">Zainuddin Labay El Yunusy</a> rather than messing around with lessons that he must memorise in class. In the library, he was free to read a variety of books, even some he borrowed to be taken home. However, because of the books he had borrowed have nothing to do with lessons in Thawalib, he was scolded by his father when he was caught busy reading <a href="/w/index.php?title=Kaba_Cindua_Mato&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kaba Cindua Mato (page does not exist)">Kaba Cindua Mato</a>. His father said, "Are you going to be a pious person or become a storyteller?"
</p><p>In an effort to prove himself to his father and as a result of his contact with the books he was reading about the appeal of <a href="/wiki/Central_Java" title="Central Java">Central Java</a>, causing Hamka to be very interested to migrate to the island of <a href="/wiki/Java" title="Java">Java</a>. At the same time, he was no longer interested in completing education at Thawalib. After studying for four years, he decided to get out of Thawalib, while the school's educational program is designed for seven years. He came out without obtaining a diploma. In those days after that, Hamka was taken to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Parabek,_Field_Laweh,_Banuhampu,_Agam&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Parabek, Field Laweh, Banuhampu, Agam (page does not exist)">Parabek</a>, about 5&#160;km from the <a href="/wiki/Bukittinggi" title="Bukittinggi">Bukittinggi</a> in 1922 to learn with <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sheikh_Ibrahim_Musa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sheikh Ibrahim Musa (page does not exist)">Sheikh Ibrahim Musa</a>, but did not last long. He preferred to follow his heart to seek knowledge and experience in his own way. He decided to leave for Java. However, the first attempt was discovered by his father.

<p>Hamka has ventured into a number of places in Minangkabau since he was a teenager, he was nicknamed by his father as "The Faraway Kid" (<i>Si Bujang Jauh</i>). At the age of 15, after experiencing an event that shook his soul, the divorce of his parents, Hamka decided to go to Java after learning that Islam in Java is more advanced than in Minangkabau, especially in terms of movement and organisation. But when he was in <a href="/wiki/Bengkulu" title="Bengkulu">Bengkulu</a>, <a href="/wiki/Smallpox" title="Smallpox">smallpox</a> stroke him, so that after about two months of being in the bed, he decided to return to Padang Panjang. Even so, his intention to go to Java was not diminished. In 1924, a year after recovering from smallpox, he departed to Java.
</p><p>Arriving in Java, Hamka went to <a href="/wiki/Yogyakarta" title="Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a> and settled in the house of his father's younger brother, Amrullah Ja'far. Through his uncle, he got the opportunity to follow the discussions and trainings organised by Islamic movements, <a href="/wiki/Muhammadiyah" title="Muhammadiyah">Muhammadiyah</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sarekat_Islam" title="Sarekat Islam">Sarekat Islam</a>. In addition of studying with the Islamic movements, he also expanded his views in the disruption of Islam's progress by <a href="/wiki/Christianization" title="Christianization">Christianization</a> and communism. While in Java, he was active in various social and religious activities. On many occasions, he studied to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Bagoes_Hadikoesoemo&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Bagoes Hadikoesoemo (page does not exist)">Bagoes Hadikoesoemo</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=HOS_Tjokroaminoto&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="HOS Tjokroaminoto (page does not exist)">HOS Tjokroaminoto</a>, <a href="/w/index.php?title=Abdul_Rozak_Fachruddin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Abdul Rozak Fachruddin (page does not exist)">Abdul Rozak Fachruddin</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Suryopranoto" title="Suryopranoto" class="mw-redirect">Suryopranoto</a>. Before returning to Minangkabau, he had wandered into <a href="/wiki/Bandung" title="Bandung">Bandung</a> and met with <a href="/wiki/Masjumi" title="Masjumi" class="mw-redirect">Masjumi</a> leaders such as <a href="/wiki/Ahmad_Hassan" title="Ahmad Hassan">Ahmad Hassan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mohammad_Natsir" title="Mohammad Natsir">Mohammad Natsir</a>, which gave him the opportunity to learn to write in the magazine Islam Defenders (<i>Pembela Islam</i>). Subsequently in 1925, he went to <a href="/wiki/Pekalongan" title="Pekalongan">Pekalongan</a>, <a href="/wiki/East_Java" title="East Java">East Java</a> to meet <a href="/w/index.php?title=Sutan_Mansur_Ahmad_Rashid&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Sutan Mansur Ahmad Rashid (page does not exist)">Sutan Mansur Ahmad Rashid</a>, who was the chairman of Muhammadiyah, Pekalongan branch at the time, and learn Islam to him. While in Pekalongan, he stayed at his brother's house and started giving religious talk in some places.
</p><p>In his first wandering in Java, he claimed to have a new spirit in studying Islam. He also saw no difference between Islamic reformation mission in Minangkabau and Java. The reformation in Minangkabau is aimed at the purification of Islam who is considered one of the practices, such as congregation, imitation, and <a href="/w/index.php?title=Khurafat&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Khurafat (page does not exist)">khurafat</a>, while in Java is more focused to the effort of combat of backwardness, ignorance and poverty.

Hamka trip to Mecca in 1927 sparked the inspiration for him to write <a href="/w/index.php?title=Under_the_Protection_of_Kaaba&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Under the Protection of Kaaba (page does not exist)">Under the Protection of Kaaba</a> (<i>Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah</i></div></div></div>
<p>After a year in Java, in July 1925 Hamka was going back to Padang Panjang. In Padang Panjang, he wrote his first magazine titled <i>Chatibul Ummah</i>, which contains a collection of speeches that he listened on <a href="/w/index.php?title=Iron_Bridge_Mosque&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Iron Bridge Mosque (page does not exist)">Iron Bridge Mosque</a> (<i>Surau Jembatan Besi</i>), and Tabligh Muhammadiyah. Between the business of his activity in the field of <a href="/wiki/Dawah" title="Dawah">Dawah</a> through writing, he took speech in several places in Padang Panjang. But at that moment, everything is precisely sharply criticised by his father, "Speeches alone are useless, fill yourself with knowledge, then those speeches would be meaningful and useful." On the other hand, he did not get a good reception from the public. He was often derided as "uncertified Islam orator", even he had received criticism from some scholars because he did not master <a href="/wiki/Arabic" title="Arabic">Arabic</a> language well. Criticism he received in his native land, he made it as a whip to make himself more mature.
</p><p>In February 1927, he took the decision to go to <a href="/wiki/Mecca" title="Mecca">Mecca</a> to extend his knowledge in Islam, including learning the Arabic language and performing his first <a href="/wiki/Hajj" title="Hajj">hajj</a> pilgrimage. He left without saying goodbye to his father and went with his own expenses. While in Mecca, he became correspondent of the daily "Andalas Light" (<i>Pelita Andalas</i>) and also worked at a printing company owned by Mr. Hamid, son of Majid Kurdish, which is the father-in-law of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Ahmad_Al-Khatib_Minangkabawi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Ahmad Al-Khatib Minangkabawi (page does not exist)">Ahmad Al-Khatib Minangkabawi</a>. At his work place, he could read classic Islamic <a href="/wiki/Kitab" title="Kitab">kitab</a>, books, and Islam newsletters in Arabic, the only foreign language he mastered.
</p><p>Towards the pilgrimage, Hamka with several other pilgrims candidate founded the East Indian Association (<i>Persatuan Hindia Timur</i>), an organisation that gives lessons to the candidate of Hajj pilgrims from Indonesia. After the pilgrimage, and for some time lived in the Holy Land, he met with <a href="/wiki/Agus_Salim" title="Agus Salim">Agus Salim</a> and had expressed his desire to settle in Mecca, but Agus Salim instead advised him to go home. "A lot of more important works regarding the movement, study, and struggle that you can do. Therefore, it would be better to develop yourself in any of your own homeland", Agus Salim said. He soon returned to his homeland after seven months of living in Mecca. However, instead of going home to Padang Panjang, Hamka instead settled in <a href="/wiki/Medan" title="Medan">Medan</a>, the city where the ship bringing him home anchored.

</p><p>During the Japanese occupation, Hamka was appointed adviser to the Japanese in terms of Islam. He was also a member of Sangi Kai Syu (a kind of assembly) that handle government and Islamic matters in 1944. He accepted this position because he believed the Japanese's promise to grant independence to Indonesia. But after occupying this position, he was regarded as an accomplice to the invaders by his friends. When Japan was defeated and surrendered to the Allies, Hamka was subjected to endless criticism. This is what forced Hamka out of the field back to the Minangkabau after the Revolutionary War broke out in 1945. Hamka was also fighting to repel the invaders. He had joined against the return of the Dutch to Indonesian guerrillas in the jungle in Medan.
