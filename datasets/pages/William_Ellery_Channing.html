<p>Channing, the son of William Channing and Lucy Ellery, was born April 7, 1780 in <a href="/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island" title="Newport, Rhode Island">Newport, Rhode Island</a>.

</p><p>Channing enrolled at <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> at a particularly troubled time, particularly because of the recent <a href="/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a>. He later wrote of these years:

<p>In opposition to traditional American Calvinist orthodoxy, Channing preferred a gentle, loving relationship with God. He opposed <a href="/wiki/Portal:Calvinism" title="Portal:Calvinism">Calvinism</a> for
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">… proclaiming a God who is to be dreaded. We are told to love and imitate God, but also that God does things we would consider most cruel in any human parent, "were he to bring his children into life totally depraved and then to pursue them with endless punishment" (Channing 1957: 56).<sup id="cite_ref-Channing39_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Channing39-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the struggle continued through two years during which Channing lived in <a href="/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia" title="Richmond, Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a> working as a tutor.  He came to his definitive faith only through much spiritual turmoil and difficulty.  Channing was called as pastor of the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Street_Church_(Boston)" title="Federal Street Church (Boston)">Federal Street Church</a> in Boston in 1803, where he remained for the rest of his life. He lived through the increasing tension between religious liberals and conservatives and took a moderate position, rejecting the extremes of both groups.
</p><p>In 1815, Channing engaged in a noted controversy on the principles of "<a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" title="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>" with <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Worcester_(theologian)" title="Samuel Worcester (theologian)">Samuel Worcester</a>, (1770-1821).<sup id="cite_ref-acab_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-acab-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> A review, attributed to <a href="/wiki/Jeremiah_Evarts" title="Jeremiah Evarts">Jeremiah Evarts</a>, had been published in the <i>"<a href="/wiki/The_Panoplist" title="The Panoplist">The Panoplist</a>"</i> in June 1815 of a pamphlet on American Unitarianism (<i>"American Unitarianism; or a Brief History of the Progress and Present State of the Unitarian Churches of America"</i>). Channing objected to the way Unitarians in the United States were portrayed in the review, Worcester replied to this objection, and an exchange of pamphlets followed.<sup id="cite_ref-dab_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dab-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Notwithstanding his moderate position, Channing later became the primary spokesman and interpreter of "<a href="/wiki/Unitarianism" title="Unitarianism">Unitarianism</a>", after sixteen years at Boston's Federal Street Church when he was invited to come south again to <a href="/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> and preached the ordination sermon of a future noted educator and theologian in his own right, <a href="/wiki/Jared_Sparks" title="Jared Sparks">Jared Sparks</a>, (1789-1866), the first minister (1819-1823) called to the newly organized congregation in <a href="/wiki/Baltimore" title="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> known as the <a href="/wiki/First_Unitarian_Church_(Baltimore,_Maryland)" title="First Unitarian Church (Baltimore, Maryland)">First Independent Church of Baltimore</a> (located at West Franklin and North Charles Streets, in a landmark two-year-old structure designed by noted French émigré architect <a href="/wiki/Maximilian_Godefroy" title="Maximilian Godefroy">J. Maximilian M. Godefroy</a> - later known as the "First Unitarian Church of Baltimore (Unitarian and Universalist)"  [after a merger with Second Universalist Church in 1935], which was forever after known as  "The Baltimore Sermon<sup id="cite_ref-American_Unitarian_Conference_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-American_Unitarian_Conference-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>"  on Sunday, May 5, 1819, (the Anniversary of which is celebrated and observed annually by the <a href="/wiki/Maryland" title="Maryland">Maryland</a> churches of the <a href="/wiki/Unitarian_Universalist_Association" title="Unitarian Universalist Association">Unitarian Universalist Association</a> and its <a href="/wiki/Districts_of_the_Unitarian_Universalist_Association" title="Districts of the Unitarian Universalist Association">Joseph Priestley District</a> as "Union Sunday", with occasional ecumenical guests from other Christian bodies). It was entitled "Unitarian Christianity".  In that "Sermon" or "Address",  he explicated the distinctive tenets of the developing "Unitarian" movement, only one of which was the rejection of the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>. Other important tenets were the belief in human goodness and the subjection of theological ideas to the light of <a href="/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reason</a>.
</p><p>In 1828, he gave another famous ordination sermon, entitled "Likeness to God".  The idea of the human potential to be like God, which Channing advocated as grounded firmly in scripture, was seen as heretical by the <a href="/wiki/Portal:Calvinism" title="Portal:Calvinism">Calvinist</a> religious establishment of his day. It is in this address which Channing first advocates the possibility for revelation through reason rather than solely from Scripture. <i>American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia</i> classes him as one of several figures who "took a more <a href="/wiki/Pantheism" title="Pantheism">pantheist</a> or <a href="/wiki/Pandeism" title="Pandeism">pandeist</a> approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In later years Channing addressed the topic of <a href="/wiki/Slavery" title="Slavery">slavery</a>, although he was never an ardent <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">abolitionist</a>.  Channing wrote a book in 1835, entitled, <i>"SLAVERY"</i><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  James Munroe and Company, publisher.  Channing, however, has been described as a "romantic racist" in <i>"Black Abolitionism: A Quest for Human Dignity"</i> by Beverly Eileen Mitchell (133–38).  He held a common American belief about the inferiority of African people and slaves and held a belief that once freed, Africans would need overseers.  The overseers (largely former slave masters) were necessary because the slaves would lapse into laziness.  Furthermore, he did not join the abolitionist movement because he did not agree with their way of conducting themselves, and he felt that voluntary associations limited a person's autonomy.  Therefore, he often chose to remain separate from organizations and reform movements.  This middle position characterized his attitude about most questions, although his eloquence and strong influence on the religious world incurred the enmity of many extremists.  Channing had an enormous influence over the religious (and social) life of New England, and America, in the nineteenth century.
</p><p>Towards the end of his life Channing embraced immediate abolitionism. His evolving view of abolitionism was fostered by the success of British <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_Kingdom" title="Abolitionism in the United Kingdom">abolition</a> in the <a href="/wiki/British_West_Indies" title="British West Indies">British West Indies</a> in 1834 and the lack of the expected social and economic upheaval in the post-emancipated <a href="/wiki/Caribbean_Sea" title="Caribbean Sea">Caribbean</a>.
</p><p>Channing wrote extensively about the emerging new national literature of the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. He wrote that national literature is "the expression of a nation's mind in writing" and "the concentration of intellect for the purpose of spreading itself abroad and multiplying its energy."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>
