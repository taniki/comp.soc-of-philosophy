<p>Born in the small village of <a href="/wiki/Celico" title="Celico">Celico</a> near <a href="/wiki/Cosenza" title="Cosenza">Cosenza</a>, in <a href="/wiki/Calabria" title="Calabria">Calabria</a> (at the time part of the <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Sicily" title="Kingdom of Sicily">Kingdom of Sicily</a>), Joachim was the son of Mauro, a well-placed notary, and of Gemma, his wife. He was educated at Cosenza, where he became first a clerk in the courts, and then a notary himself, and worked in 1166-1167 for <a href="/wiki/Stephen_du_Perche" title="Stephen du Perche">Stephen du Perche</a>, archbishop of Palermo from 1167 to 1168 and counsellor of <a href="/wiki/Margaret_of_Navarre" title="Margaret of Navarre">Margaret of Navarre</a>, regent for the young <a href="/wiki/William_II_of_Sicily" title="William II of Sicily">William II of Sicily</a>.

<p>About 1159 he went on <a href="/wiki/Pilgrimage" title="Pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Land" title="Holy Land">Holy Land</a>, an episode about which very little is known, save that he underwent a spiritual crisis and conversion in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> that turned him away from a worldly life. When he returned, he lived as a <a href="/wiki/Hermit" title="Hermit">hermit</a> for several years, wandering and preaching before joining the ascetic <a href="/wiki/Cistercian_Order" title="Cistercian Order" class="mw-redirect">Cistercian</a> abbey of Sambucina near <a href="/wiki/Luzzi" title="Luzzi">Luzzi</a> in Calabria, as a lay brother, where he devoted his time to lay preaching. Under pressure from the ecclesiastical authorities, he joined the monks of the <a href="/wiki/Lamezia_Terme#Main_sights" title="Lamezia Terme">Abbey of Corazzo</a>, and was ordained priest, apparently in 1168. He applied himself entirely to Biblical study, with a special view to uncovering the arcane meaning concealed in the Scriptures, above all in <a href="/wiki/Revelation" title="Revelation">Revelation</a>. To his dismay, the monks of Corazzo proclaimed him their abbot (c. 1177). He then attempted to join the monastery to the <a href="/wiki/Cistercian_Order" title="Cistercian Order" class="mw-redirect">Cistercian Order</a>, but was refused because of the community's poverty. In the winter of 1178 he appealed in person to William II, who granted the monks some lands.
</p><p>In 1182 Joachim appealed to <a href="/wiki/Pope_Lucius_III" title="Pope Lucius III">Pope Lucius III</a>, who relieved him of the temporal care of his abbey, and warmly approved of his work, bidding him continue it in whatever monastery he thought best. Joachim spent the following year and a half at the Cistercian <a href="/wiki/Abbey_of_Casamari" title="Abbey of Casamari" class="mw-redirect">Abbey of Casamari</a>, where he engaged in writing his three great books, his dictations keeping three scribes busy night and day; there the young monk, Lucas (afterwards <a href="/wiki/Archbishop_of_Cosenza" title="Archbishop of Cosenza" class="mw-redirect">Archbishop of Cosenza</a>), who acted as his secretary, was amazed to see so famous and eloquent a man wearing such rags, and the wonderful devotion with which he preached and said Mass.
</p><p>In 1184 he was in Rome, interpreting an obscure prophecy found among the papers of Cardinal Matthew of Angers, and was encouraged by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Lucius_III" title="Pope Lucius III">Pope Lucius III</a>. Succeeding popes confirmed the papal approbation, though his manuscripts had not begun to circulate.  Joachim retired first to the hermitage of Pietralata, writing all the while, and then founded the Abbey of Fiore (<i>Flora</i>) in the mountains of Calabria. He refused the request of King <a href="/wiki/Tancred_of_Sicily" title="Tancred of Sicily" class="mw-redirect">Tancred of Sicily</a> (reigned 1189-1194) to move his new religious foundation to the existing Cistercian monastery of <a href="/wiki/Santa_Maria_della_Matina" title="Santa Maria della Matina">Santa Maria della Matina</a>. Flora became the center of a new and stricter branch of the Cistercian order, approved by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Celestine_III" title="Pope Celestine III">Celestine III</a> in 1198.
</p><p>In 1200 Joachim publicly submitted all his writings to the examination of <a href="/wiki/Pope_Innocent_III" title="Pope Innocent III">Innocent III</a>, but died before any judgment was passed.  The holiness of his life was widely known: <a href="/wiki/Dante" title="Dante" class="mw-redirect">Dante</a> affirmed that miracles were said to have been wrought at his tomb,<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>The mystical basis of his teaching is his doctrine of the "eternal gospel," founded on an interpretation of Revelation 14:6 (Rev 14:6, "Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation and tribe and language and people." NRSV translation.)
</p><p>His theories can be considered <a href="/wiki/Millenarian" title="Millenarian" class="mw-redirect">millenarian</a>; he believed that history, by analogy with the <a href="/wiki/Trinity" title="Trinity">Trinity</a>, was divided into three fundamental epochs:
</p>
<ul><li> The <b>Age of the Father</b>, corresponding to the <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, characterized by obedience of mankind to the Rules of God;</li>
<li> The <b>Age of the Son</b>, between the advent of Christ and 1260, represented by the <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>, when Man became the son of God;</li>
<li> The <b>Age of the Holy Spirit</b>, impending (in 1260), ushered in by an <i>Angel with a sword</i>, when mankind was to come in direct contact with God, reaching the total freedom preached by the Christian message. The Kingdom of the Holy Spirit, a new dispensation of universal love, would proceed from the Gospel of Christ, but transcend the letter of it. In this new Age the ecclesiastical organization would be replaced and the <i>Order of the Just</i> would rule the Church. This <i>Order of the Just</i> was later identified with the <a href="/wiki/Franciscan" title="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> order by his follower <a href="/wiki/Gerardo_of_Borgo_San_Donnino" title="Gerardo of Borgo San Donnino">Gerardo of Borgo San Donnino</a>.</li></ul>
<p>According to Joachim, only in this third Age will it be possible to really understand the words of God in its deepest meanings, and not merely literally. He concluded  that this age would begin in 1260 based on the <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Revelation" title="Book of Revelation">Book of Revelation</a> (verses 11:3 and 12:6, which mention "one thousand two hundred and sixty days").<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In this year, instead of the <i>parousia</i> (second Advent of Christ), a new Epoch of peace and concord would begin, thus making the hierarchy of the Church unnecessary.
</p><p>Joachim distinguished between the "reign of justice" or of "law", in an imperfect society, and the "reign of freedom" in a perfect society.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>

Among the Spirituals, the stricter branch of the <a href="/wiki/Franciscan_Order" title="Franciscan Order" class="mw-redirect">Franciscans</a>, a Joachite group arose, many of whom saw Antichrist already in the world in the person of <a href="/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor">Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor</a> (who died in 1250).
</p><p>As the appointed year approached, spurious works began to circulate under Joachim's name: <i>De Oneribus Prophetarum,</i> an <i>Expositio Sybillae et Merlini</i> ("Exposition of the <a href="/wiki/Sibyl" title="Sibyl">Sibyl</a> and <a href="/wiki/Merlin_(wizard)" title="Merlin (wizard)" class="mw-redirect">Merlin</a>") and commentaries on the prophecies of Jeremiah and Isaiah. The <a href="/wiki/Fourth_Council_of_the_Lateran" title="Fourth Council of the Lateran">Fourth Council of the Lateran</a> in 1215 condemned some of his ideas about the nature of the Trinity. Finally <a href="/wiki/Pope_Alexander_IV" title="Pope Alexander IV">Pope Alexander IV</a> condemned his writings and those of his follower <a href="/wiki/Gerardo_of_Borgo_San_Donnino" title="Gerardo of Borgo San Donnino">Gerardo of Borgo San Donnino</a> and set up a commission that in 1263 at the <a href="/wiki/Synod_of_Arles" title="Synod of Arles">Synod of Arles</a> declared Joachim's theories <a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">heretical</a>.
</p><p>His views also inspired subsequent <a href="/wiki/Heresy" title="Heresy">heresies</a> like <a href="/wiki/Amalrician" title="Amalrician">Amalricians</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dulcinian" title="Dulcinian">Dulcinians</a> and <a href="/wiki/Brethren_of_the_Free_Spirit" title="Brethren of the Free Spirit">Brethren of the Free Spirit</a>.
</p><p>Of importance is the fact that Joachim himself was never condemned as a heretic by the Church; rather, the ideas and movement surrounding him were condemned. Joachim the man was held in high regard during his lifetime.
