<p><b>Laurence Sterne</b> (24 November 1713 – 18 March 1768) was an Irish novelist and an <a href="/wiki/Anglican" title="Anglican" class="mw-redirect">Anglican</a> clergyman.

<p>Sterne was born in <a href="/wiki/Clonmel" title="Clonmel">Clonmel</a>, <a href="/wiki/County_Tipperary" title="County Tipperary">County Tipperary</a>.

</p><p>The first decade of Sterne's life was spent moving from place to place as his father was reassigned throughout Ireland.  During this period Sterne never lived in one place for more than a year. In addition to Clonmel and Dublin, his family also lived in, among other places, Wicklow Town, <a href="/wiki/Annamoe" title="Annamoe">Annamoe</a> (<a href="/wiki/County_Wicklow" title="County Wicklow">County Wicklow</a>), <a href="/wiki/Drogheda" title="Drogheda">Drogheda</a> (<a href="/wiki/County_Louth" title="County Louth">County Louth</a>), <a href="/wiki/Castlepollard" title="Castlepollard">Castlepollard</a> (<a href="/wiki/County_Westmeath" title="County Westmeath">County Westmeath</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Carrickfergus" title="Carrickfergus">Carrickfergus</a> (<a href="/wiki/County_Antrim" title="County Antrim">County Antrim</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> In 1724, his father took Sterne to Roger's wealthy brother, Richard, so that Sterne could attend  <a href="/wiki/Hipperholme_Grammar_School" title="Hipperholme Grammar School">Hipperholme Grammar School</a> near <a href="/wiki/Halifax,_West_Yorkshire" title="Halifax, West Yorkshire">Halifax</a>; Sterne never saw his father again as Roger was ordered to <a href="/wiki/Jamaica" title="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> where he died of a fever in 1731.

<p>Sterne was ordained as a <a href="/wiki/Deacon" title="Deacon">deacon</a> in March 1737 and as a priest in August 1738. Shortly thereafter Sterne was awarded the vicarship living of <a href="/wiki/Sutton-on-the-Forest" title="Sutton-on-the-Forest">Sutton-on-the-Forest</a> in Yorkshire. Sterne married Elizabeth Lumley in 1741.  Both were ill with consumption. In 1743, he was presented to the neighbouring living of <a href="/wiki/Stillington,_North_Yorkshire" title="Stillington, North Yorkshire">Stillington</a> by Rev. Richard <a href="/wiki/Levett" title="Levett">Levett</a>, Prebendary of Stillington, who was patron of the living.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Subsequently Sterne did duty both there and at Sutton. He was also a <a href="/wiki/Prebendary" title="Prebendary">prebendary</a> of <a href="/wiki/York_Minster" title="York Minster">York Minster</a>. Sterne's life at this time was closely tied with his uncle, Dr Jaques Sterne, the <a href="/wiki/Archdeacon" title="Archdeacon">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="/wiki/Cleveland,_England" title="Cleveland, England">Cleveland</a> and <a href="/wiki/Precentor" title="Precentor">Precentor</a> of York Minster.

</p><p>Jaques Sterne was a powerful clergyman but a mean-tempered man and a rabid politician. In 1741–42 Sterne wrote political articles supporting the administration of <a href="/wiki/Sir_Robert_Walpole" title="Sir Robert Walpole" class="mw-redirect">Sir Robert Walpole</a> for a newspaper founded by his uncle but soon withdrew from politics in disgust. His uncle became his arch-enemy, thwarting his advancement whenever possible.

<p>In 1759, to support his dean in a church squabble, Sterne wrote <i><a href="/wiki/A_Political_Romance" title="A Political Romance">A Political Romance</a></i> (later called <i>The History of a Good Warm Watch-Coat</i>), a Swiftian satire of dignitaries of the spiritual courts. At the demands of embarrassed churchmen, the book was burned. Thus, Sterne lost his chances for clerical advancement but discovered his real talents; until the completion of this first work, "he hardly knew that he could write at all, much less with humour so as to make his reader laugh".<sup id="cite_ref-Cross178_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cross178-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Having discovered his talent, at the age of 46, he turned over his parishes to a curate, and dedicated himself to writing for the rest of his life. It was while living in the countryside, having failed in his attempts to supplement his income as a farmer and struggling with tuberculosis, that Sterne began work on his best known novel, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy,_Gentleman" title="The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman">The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</a></i>, the first volumes of which were published in 1759. Sterne was at work on his celebrated comic novel during the year that his mother died, his wife was seriously ill, and his daughter was also taken ill with a fever.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> He wrote as fast as he possibly could, composing the first 18 chapters between January and March 1759.<sup id="cite_ref-Cross178_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Cross178-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>An initial, sharply satiric version was rejected by Robert Dodsley, the London printer, just when Sterne's personal life was upset. His mother and uncle both died. His wife had a nervous breakdown and threatened suicide. Sterne continued his comic novel, but every sentence, he said, was "written under the greatest heaviness of heart." In this mood, he softened the satire and recounted details of Tristram's opinions, eccentric family and ill-fated childhood with a sympathetic humour, sometimes hilarious, sometimes sweetly melancholic—a <a href="/wiki/Tragicomedy" title="Tragicomedy">comedy skirting tragedy</a>.
</p><p>The publication of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> made Sterne famous in London and on the continent.  He was delighted by the attention, and spent part of each year in London, being fêted as new volumes appeared. Indeed, <a href="/wiki/Baron_Fauconberg" title="Baron Fauconberg">Baron Fauconberg</a> rewarded Sterne by appointing him as the perpetual <a href="/wiki/Curate" title="Curate">curate</a> of <a href="/wiki/Coxwold" title="Coxwold">Coxwold</a>, North Yorkshire.

<p>Sterne continued to struggle with his illness, and departed England for France in 1762 in an effort to find a climate that would alleviate his suffering. Sterne was lucky to attach himself to a diplomatic party bound for <a href="/wiki/Turin" title="Turin">Turin</a>, as England and France were still adversaries in the <a href="/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War" title="Seven Years' War">Seven Years' War</a>.  Sterne was gratified by his reception in France where reports of the genius of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> had made him a celebrity.  Aspects of this trip to France were incorporated into Sterne's second novel, <i><a href="/wiki/A_Sentimental_Journey_Through_France_and_Italy" title="A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy">A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy</a></i>, which was published at the beginning of 1768.  The novel was written during a period in which Sterne was increasingly ill and weak.

<p>Less than a month after <i>Sentimental Journey</i> was published, early in 1768, Sterne's strength failed him, and he died in his lodgings at 41 <a href="/wiki/Old_Bond_Street" title="Old Bond Street" class="mw-redirect">Old Bond Street</a> on 18 March, at the age of 54. He was buried in the churchyard of <a href="/wiki/St_George%27s,_Hanover_Square" title="St George's, Hanover Square">St George's, Hanover Square</a>.
</p><p>It was widely rumoured that Sterne's body was stolen shortly after it was interred and sold to <a href="/wiki/Anatomist" title="Anatomist" class="mw-redirect">anatomists</a> at Cambridge University. Circumstantially, it was said that his body was recognised by <a href="/wiki/Charles_Collignon_(surgeon)" title="Charles Collignon (surgeon)">Charles Collignon</a> who knew him<sup id="cite_ref-arnold_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-arnold-7">[7]</a></sup> and discreetly reinterred back in St George's, in an unknown plot. A year later a group of <a href="/wiki/Freemason" title="Freemason" class="mw-redirect">Freemasons</a> erected a memorial stone with a rhyming epitaph near to his original burial place. A second stone was erected in 1893, correcting some factual errors on the memorial stone. When the <a href="/wiki/Churchyard" title="Churchyard">churchyard</a> of St. George's was redeveloped in 1969, amongst 11,500 skulls disinterred, several were identified with drastic cuts from anatomising or a post-mortem examination.

</p><p>The skull was held up to be his, albeit with "a certain area of doubt".

<p>Sterne's early works were letters; he had two ordinary sermons published (in 1747 and 1750), and tried his hand at satire. He was involved in, and wrote about, local politics in 1742. His major publication prior to <i>Tristram Shandy</i> was the satire <i><a href="/wiki/A_Political_Romance" title="A Political Romance">A Political Romance</a></i> (1759), aimed at conflicts of interest within <a href="/wiki/York_Minster" title="York Minster">York Minster</a>.

</p>
<blockquote>I ... deny I have gone as far as Swift: he keeps a due distance from Rabelais; I keep a due distance from him.</blockquote>
<p>Sterne is best known for his novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Life_and_Opinions_of_Tristram_Shandy,_Gentleman" title="The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman">The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</a></i>, for which he became famous not only in England, but throughout Europe. Translations of the work began to appear in all the major European languages almost upon its publication, and Sterne influenced European writers as diverse as <a href="/wiki/Denis_Diderot" title="Denis Diderot">Diderot</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">German Romanticists</a>. His work had also noticeable influence over Brazilian author <a href="/wiki/Machado_de_Assis" title="Machado de Assis">Machado de Assis</a>, who made exceptional (and outstandingly original) usage of the digressive technique in the masterful novel <i><a href="/wiki/The_Posthumous_Memoirs_of_Bras_Cubas" title="The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas">The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas</a></i>.  Indeed, the novel, in which Sterne manipulates narrative time and voice, parodies accepted narrative form, and includes a healthy dose of "<a href="/wiki/Bawdy" title="Bawdy" class="mw-redirect">bawdy</a>" humour, was largely dismissed in England as being too corrupt. <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Johnson" title="Samuel Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a>'s verdict in 1776 was that "Nothing odd will do long. <i>Tristram Shandy</i> did not last." 
</p><p>This is strikingly different from the views of European critics of the day, who praised Sterne and <i>Tristram Shandy</i> as innovative and superior. <a href="/wiki/Voltaire" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> called it "clearly superior to <a href="/wiki/Rabelais" title="Rabelais" class="mw-redirect">Rabelais</a>", and later <a href="/wiki/Goethe" title="Goethe" class="mw-redirect">Goethe</a> praised Sterne as "the most beautiful spirit that ever lived." Both during his life and for a long time after, efforts were made by many to reclaim Sterne as an <a href="/wiki/Sensibility" title="Sensibility">arch-sentimentalist</a>; parts of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, such as the tale of Le Fever, were excerpted and published separately to wide acclaim from the moralists of the day. The success of the novel and its serialised nature also allowed many imitators to publish pamphlets concerning the Shandean characters and other Shandean-related material even while the novel was yet unfinished.
</p><p>The novel itself is difficult to describe. The story starts with the narration, by Tristram, of his own conception. It proceeds by fits and starts, but mostly by what Sterne calls "progressive digressions" so that we do not reach Tristram's birth before the third volume. The novel is rich in characters and humour, and the influences of <a href="/wiki/Rabelais" title="Rabelais" class="mw-redirect">Rabelais</a> and <a href="/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes" title="Miguel de Cervantes">Cervantes</a> are present throughout. The novel ends after 9 volumes, published over a decade, but without anything that might be considered a traditional conclusion. Sterne inserts sermons, essays and legal documents into the pages of his novel; and he explores the limits of typography and print design by including marbled pages and, most famously, an entirely black page, within the narrative. Many of the innovations that Sterne introduced, adaptations in form that should be understood as an exploration of what constitutes the novel, were highly influential to <a href="/wiki/Modernism" title="Modernism">Modernist</a> writers like <a href="/wiki/James_Joyce" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a> and <a href="/wiki/Virginia_Woolf" title="Virginia Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, and more contemporary writers such as <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon" title="Thomas Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace" title="David Foster Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>. <a href="/wiki/Italo_Calvino" title="Italo Calvino">Italo Calvino</a> referred to <i>Tristram Shandy</i> as the "undoubted progenitor of all avant-garde novels of our century". The <a href="/wiki/Russian_Formalism" title="Russian Formalism" class="mw-redirect">Russian Formalist</a> writer <a href="/wiki/Viktor_Shklovsky" title="Viktor Shklovsky">Viktor Shklovsky</a> regarded <i>Tristram Shandy</i> as the archetypal, quintessential novel, of which all other novels are mere subsets: "<i>Tristram Shandy</i> is the most typical novel of world literature."<sup id="cite_ref-andromeda.rutgers.edu_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-andromeda.rutgers.edu-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, the leading critical opinions of <i>Tristram Shandy</i> tend to be markedly polarised in their evaluations of its significance. Since the 1950s, following the lead of DW Jefferson, there are those who argue that, whatever its legacy of influence may be, <i>Tristram Shandy</i> in its original context actually represents a resurgence of a much older, <a href="/wiki/Renaissance" title="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> tradition of "Learned Wit" – owing a debt to such influences as the <a href="/wiki/Scriblerus_Club" title="Scriblerus Club">Scriblerian</a> approach.
</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/A_Sentimental_Journey_Through_France_and_Italy" title="A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy">A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy</a></i> is a less influential book, although it was better received by English critics of the day. The book has many stylistic parallels with <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, and indeed, the narrator is one of the minor characters from the earlier novel. Although the story is more straightforward, <i>A Sentimental Journey</i> can be understood to be part of the same artistic project to which <i>Tristram Shandy</i> belongs.
</p><p>Two volumes of Sterne's <i>Sermons</i> were published during his lifetime; more copies of his <i>Sermons</i> were sold in his lifetime than copies of <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, and for a while he was better known in some circles as a preacher than as a novelist. The sermons, though, are conventional in both style and substance. Several volumes of letters were published after his death, as was <i><a href="/wiki/Journal_to_Eliza" title="Journal to Eliza">Journal to Eliza</a></i>, a more sentimental than humorous love letter to a woman Sterne was courting during the final years of his life. Compared to many eighteenth-century authors, Sterne's body of work is quite small.

<p>In 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, the composer and former slave <a href="/wiki/Ignatius_Sancho" title="Ignatius Sancho">Ignatius Sancho</a> wrote to Sterne<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> encouraging him to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That subject, handled in your striking manner, would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many—but if only one—Gracious God!—what a feast to a benevolent heart!"
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In July 1766 Sterne received Sancho's letter shortly after he had finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, wherein Tom described the oppression of a black servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon which he had visited.<sup id="cite_ref-Norton_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Norton-15">[15]</a></sup> Sterne's widely publicised response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a strange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me—but why her brethren?—or your’s, Sancho! any more than mine? It is by the finest tints, and most insensible gradations, that nature descends from the fairest face about St. James’s, to the sootiest complexion in Africa: at which tint of these, is it, that the ties of blood are to cease? and how many shades must we descend lower still in the scale, ’ere mercy is to vanish with them?—but ’tis no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to use the other half of it like brutes, &amp; then endeavor to make ’em so.|Laurence Sterne, 27 July 1766<sup id="cite_ref-Norton_15-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Norton-15">[15]</a></sup>
