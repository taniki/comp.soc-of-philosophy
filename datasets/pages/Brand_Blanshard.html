<p>Brand Blanshard was born August 27, 1892 in <a href="/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Ohio" title="Fredericksburg, Ohio">Fredericksburg, Ohio</a>. His parents were Francis, a Congregational minister, and Emily Coulter Blanshard, Canadians who met in high school in <a href="/wiki/Weston,_Toronto" title="Weston, Toronto">Weston</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ontario" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Freethought" title="Freethought">freethinker</a> and sometime <i><a href="/wiki/The_Nation_(U.S._periodical)" title="The Nation (U.S. periodical)" class="mw-redirect">The Nation</a></i> editor <a href="/wiki/Paul_Blanshard" title="Paul Blanshard">Paul Beecher Blanshard</a> was his fraternal twin. During a visit to Toronto in 1893, their mother Emily fell down stairs while holding a kerosene lamp. She died of burns the next day. The Rev. Mr. Blanshard brought his sons to <a href="/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan" title="Grand Rapids, Michigan">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, for maternal care by his mother, Orminda Adams Blanshard, widow of Methodist clergyman Shem Blanshard. Francis briefly left them in her care to pastor a church in <a href="/wiki/Helena,_Montana" title="Helena, Montana">Helena, Montana</a>. In 1899 the four moved south to <a href="/wiki/Edinburg,_Ohio" title="Edinburg, Ohio">Edinburg, Ohio</a>. Upon being diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, Francis was advised to seek the drier climate of the American West. In 1902, Francis Blanshard bade his mother and sons goodbye. The family moved northwest to <a href="/wiki/Bay_View,_Michigan" title="Bay View, Michigan">Bay View, Michigan</a>, while Francis moved alone to <a href="/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, where, in 1904, he died, alone in a tent.
</p><p>Mrs. Orminda Blanshard raised her grandsons on an annual pension of $250 from the Methodist church while the boys washed dishes at a restaurant. Realizing their need for good education, the family relocated to Detroit in 1908 so the boys could graduate from the well known <a href="/wiki/Central_High_School_(Detroit,_Michigan)" title="Central High School (Detroit, Michigan)" class="mw-redirect">Central High School</a>. Soon both were at the top of their class, joined the debating team, and Brand was made class Poet. Many years later, <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> was to express surprise at the quality of Brand's poetry. Brand also excelled at baseball.
</p><p>In 1910 the Blanshard brothers entered the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, whose annual tuition was only $30 for state residents. Brand discovered philosophy while majoring in classics. After a mere three years at Michigan, he obtained a <a href="/wiki/Rhodes_Scholarship" title="Rhodes Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to study at <a href="/wiki/Merton_College,_Oxford" title="Merton College, Oxford">Merton College, Oxford</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-MCreg_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MCreg-2">[2]</a></sup> where he studied under <a href="/w/index.php?title=Horace_W._B._Joseph&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Horace W. B. Joseph (page does not exist)">Horace W. B. Joseph</a>, who greatly influenced him, and met <a href="/wiki/F.H._Bradley" title="F.H. Bradley" class="mw-redirect">F.H.

Upon the outbreak of <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, he interrupted his studies and joined the British Army YMCA, which sent him to <a href="/wiki/Bombay" title="Bombay" class="mw-redirect">Bombay</a> and <a href="/wiki/Amhara_Region" title="Amhara Region">Amhara</a>, where he witnessed poverty and the horrors of war at first hand. German submarine warfare forced him to return to the USA via Japan. Fate reunited the Blanshard twins at <a href="/wiki/Columbia_University" title="Columbia University">Columbia University</a> where Paul was studying the new field of Sociology. The brothers participated in a project run by their shared mentor and friend, <a href="/wiki/John_Dewey" title="John Dewey">John Dewey</a>. On this project they met Frances Bradshaw of Smith College - see below. Brand obtained his M.A., studying under <a href="/wiki/William_Pepperell_Montague" title="William Pepperell Montague">W.P.

Once demobilized, he returned to Oxford to complete his BA (Hons) and then earned his doctorate at Harvard under <a href="/wiki/Clarence_Irving_Lewis" title="Clarence Irving Lewis">Clarence Irving Lewis</a>.
</p><p>After a short teaching stint at Michigan, he taught at <a href="/wiki/Swarthmore_College" title="Swarthmore College">Swarthmore College</a> from 1925 to 1944. He spent the remainder of his career at <a href="/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> until his retirement in 1961.  At Yale, he served as chairman of the Department of Philosophy for many years. In 1952, he delivered the <a href="/wiki/Gifford_Lectures" title="Gifford Lectures">Gifford Lectures</a> in Scotland. In 1955 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Merton College.<sup id="cite_ref-MCreg_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MCreg-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1918, Blanshard married Frances Bradshaw,<sup id="cite_ref-MCreg_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-MCreg-2">[2]</a></sup> who would become dean of women at Swarthmore.

In 1969, after what he later described as "loneliness, failing health, and failing motives," he married Roberta Yerkes, a daughter of his Yale colleague <a href="/wiki/Robert_M._Yerkes" title="Robert M.

<p>Blanshard was a <a href="/wiki/Rationalism" title="Rationalism">rationalist</a> who espoused and defended a strong conception of <a href="/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reason</a> during a century when reason came under philosophical attack. Generally regarded as one of the last great absolute <a href="/wiki/Idealism" title="Idealism">idealists</a> and strongly influenced by <a href="/wiki/British_idealism" title="British idealism">British idealism</a> (especially <a href="/wiki/F.H._Bradley" title="F.H. Bradley" class="mw-redirect">F.H. Bradley</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Bosanquet_(philosopher)" title="Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)">Bernard Bosanquet</a>), he nevertheless departed from absolute idealism in some respects.  Blanshard distinguished <a href="/wiki/Epistemological_idealism" title="Epistemological idealism">epistemological idealism</a> (the position that all objects of direct experience exist only in consciousness) from <a href="/wiki/Ontological" title="Ontological" class="mw-redirect">ontological</a> idealism (the position that the world in itself is mental, or made of mind-stuff).  He accepted epistemological idealism but, unlike <a href="/wiki/George_Berkeley" title="George Berkeley">Berkeley</a>, <a href="/wiki/G.W.F._Hegel" title="G.W.F. Hegel" class="mw-redirect">Hegel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Josiah_Royce" title="Josiah Royce">Royce</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Bernard_Bosanquet_(philosopher)" title="Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)">Bosanquet</a>, was not prepared to take the extra step to ontological idealism.  He allowed that the material world, and the atomic particles of which it is thought to be composed, may exist independently of mind.  In this sense, he did not accept the basic dictum of Berkeleian ontological idealism, that <i>esse est percipi</i> (to be is to be perceived).
</p><p>Strongly critical of <a href="/wiki/Positivism" title="Positivism">positivism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Logical_atomism" title="Logical atomism">logical atomism</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pragmatism" title="Pragmatism">pragmatism</a>, and most varieties of <a href="/wiki/Empiricism" title="Empiricism">empiricism</a>, he held that the universe consists of an <a href="/wiki/The_Absolute" title="The Absolute" class="mw-redirect">Absolute</a> in the form of a single all-encompassing intelligible system in which each element has a necessary place. Moreover, this Absolute—the universe as a whole—he held to be the only true "<a href="/wiki/Particular" title="Particular">particular</a>", all elements within it being ultimately resoluble into specific "<a href="/wiki/Universal_(metaphysics)" title="Universal (metaphysics)">universals</a>" (properties, relations, or combinations thereof that might be given identically in more than one context). He regarded his metaphysical <a href="/wiki/Monism" title="Monism">monism</a> as essentially a form of <a href="/wiki/Baruch_Spinoza" title="Baruch Spinoza">Spinozism</a>.
</p><p>Also strongly critical of <a href="/wiki/Reductionism" title="Reductionism">reductionist</a> accounts of <a href="/wiki/Mind" title="Mind">mind</a> (e.g., <a href="/wiki/Behaviorism" title="Behaviorism">behaviorism</a>), he maintained to the contrary that mind is the reality of which we are in fact <i>most</i> certain. Thought, he held, is that activity of mind which aims at <a href="/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a>, and the ultimate object of thought is full understanding of the Absolute. Such understanding comes about, in his view, through a grasp of <a href="/wiki/Necessity" title="Necessity">necessity</a>: to understand (or explain) something is to see it as necessitated within a system of which it is a part.
</p><p>On Blanshard's view, the Absolute is thus not merely consistent (i.e., noncontradictory) but positively coherent, shot through with relations of necessity and indeed operating purely <a href="/wiki/Determinism" title="Determinism">deterministically</a>. (Blanshard held the law of <a href="/wiki/Causality" title="Causality">causality</a>, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot <i>prove</i> that there are no atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, but we can take it as our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are always to be found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally. 
</p><p>In his early work <i>The Nature of Thought</i>, he defended a <a href="/wiki/Coherentism" title="Coherentism">coherence theory of truth</a>. In his later years, however, he came to think that the relation between thought and object was <i>sui generis</i> and might be described, about equally inadequately, as either "correspondence" or "coherence"; at any rate, he admitted, the "coherence" between thought and its ideal object differs from the coherence that may obtain among thoughts. He also backed away from his early (more or less Bradleian) claim that the ultimate aim of thought was <i>identification</i> with its object.
</p><p>He defended a strong doctrine of <a href="/w/index.php?title=Internal_relations&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Internal relations (page does not exist)">internal relations</a>. He maintained, with longtime friend and philosophical colleague <a href="/wiki/A.C._Ewing" title="A.C. Ewing" class="mw-redirect">A.C. Ewing</a>, that the doctrine would have caught on far better had it been more accurately described in terms of "relevance" rather than of "internality". His doctrine on this point was that no relation is <i>entirely</i> irrelevant to the natures of the terms it relates, such relevance (and therefore "internality") being a matter of degree. One of Blanshard's most important exchanges on this topic was with <a href="/wiki/Philosophy" title="Philosophy">philosopher</a> <a href="/wiki/Ernest_Nagel" title="Ernest Nagel">Ernest Nagel</a>, who attacked the doctrine of internal relations — indeed, Blanshard's entire conception of reason — in his essay "Sovereign Reason". Blanshard's fullest published reply appears in his book <i>Reason and Analysis</i>.
</p><p>Sympathetic to <a href="/wiki/Theism" title="Theism">theism</a> but skeptical of traditional religious and theological dogma, he did not regard his Absolute as having the characteristics of a personal <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a> but nevertheless maintained that it was a proper subject of (rational) religious inquiry and even devotion. Defining "religion" as the dedication of one's whole person to whatever one regards as true and important, he took as his own religion the service of <a href="/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reason</a> in a very full and all-encompassing metaphysical sense, defending what he called the "rational temper" as a human ideal (though one exceedingly difficult to achieve in practice). His admiration for this temper extended his philosophical loyalties across "party lines", especially to the one philosopher he regarded as exemplifying that temper to the greatest degree: <a href="/wiki/Henry_Sidgwick" title="Henry Sidgwick">Henry Sidgwick</a>. (He also spoke highly of <a href="/wiki/Bertrand_Russell" title="Bertrand Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>.) Theologically, Blanshard was raised Methodist but tended toward theological liberalism from an early age, a tendency that became more pronounced as he grew older. Beginning during his time at Swarthmore, he maintained a lifelong connection with the <a href="/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="Religious Society of Friends" class="mw-redirect">Religious Society of Friends</a> despite personal disagreements with some of Quakerism's generally accepted tenets (notably its <a href="/wiki/Pacifism" title="Pacifism">pacifism</a>).
</p><p>In ethics, he was broadly <a href="/wiki/Utilitarianism" title="Utilitarianism">utilitarian</a>; however, he preferred the term "<a href="/wiki/Teleology" title="Teleology">teleological</a>" since the term "utilitarian" suggested that all goods were instrumental and he believed (with, e.g., H.W.B. Joseph and <a href="/wiki/W.D._Ross" title="W.D. Ross" class="mw-redirect">W.D. Ross</a>) that some experiences were intrinsically good. He also denied that pleasure is the sole good, maintaining instead (with <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hill_Green" title="Thomas Hill Green">T.H. Green</a>) that experiences are good as wholes and that pleasure is not, strictly speaking, a separable element within such wholes. Disagreeing with <a href="/wiki/G.E._Moore" title="G.E. Moore" class="mw-redirect">G.E. Moore</a> that the "<a href="/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy" title="Naturalistic fallacy">naturalistic fallacy</a>" is really a fallacy, he gave an entirely naturalistic analysis of goodness, holding that an experience is intrinsically good to the degree that it (a) fulfills an impulse or drive and (b) generates a feeling-tone of satisfaction attendant upon such fulfillment. He regarded the first of these factors as by far the more important and held that the major intrinsic goods of human experience answer to the basic drives of human nature; he maintained that these two factors together provide not merely a criterion for but the actual meaning of intrinsic goodness. (He defined all other ethical terms, including "right", in terms of intrinsic goodness, a right act, for example, being that act which tends to produce the greatest amount of intrinsic goodness under the relevant circumstances.)
</p><p>The little that Blanshard wrote on <a href="/wiki/Political_theory" title="Political theory" class="mw-redirect">political theory</a> (mainly in <i>Reason and Goodness</i>) owed much to Green and Bosanquet. These two philosophers, he held, had rescued <a href="/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau" title="Jean-Jacques Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s confused doctrine of the <a href="/wiki/General_will" title="General will">general will</a> and placed it on a rationally-defensible footing. Our "real will" (in Bosanquet's terms) or "rational will" (in Blanshard's) is simply that which we <i>would</i> want, all things considered, if our reflections upon what we presently desire were pursued to their ideal limit. Blanshard argued that there is excellent reason to regard this "ideal" will as in fact real, and contended that it provided the foundation for a rational political theory. The state is justified if, and precisely insofar as, it helps individual human beings to pursue and achieve the common end which is the object of their rational will. He did not develop this doctrine to the point of advocating any specific form of political organization or social structure. In his Schilpp autobiography, he admitted to an early sympathy for <a href="/wiki/Socialism" title="Socialism">socialism</a> and to having voted the "straight Democratic ticket" over the previous 40-odd years.
</p><p>A firm believer in clarity of exposition and himself one of the ablest writers of philosophical prose in the English language, he wrote an essay "On Philosophical Style" in defense of the view that philosophical profundity need not (and should not) be couched in obscurity and obfuscation.
