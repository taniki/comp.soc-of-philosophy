<p>He was born in <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, the son of George Jeffrey, a clerk in the <a href="/wiki/Court_of_Session" title="Court of Session">Court of Session</a>.  After attending the <a href="/wiki/Royal_High_School_(Edinburgh)" title="Royal High School (Edinburgh)" class="mw-redirect">Royal High School</a> for six years, he studied at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Glasgow" title="University of Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a> from 1787 to May 1789, and at <a href="/wiki/The_Queen%27s_College,_Oxford" title="The Queen's College, Oxford">Queen's College, Oxford</a>, from September 1791 to June 1792.

<p>In consequence of his lack of success at the bar he went to London in 1798 to try his hand at journalism, but without success; he also failed in his attempts to obtain a salaried position. His marriage to Catherine Wilson in 1801 made the question of a settled income even more pressing. A project for a new review, brought up by <a href="/wiki/Sydney_Smith" title="Sydney Smith">Sydney Smith</a> in Jeffrey's flat (on Buccleuch Place) in the presence of Henry Brougham (afterwards Lord Brougham), Francis Homer and others, resulted in the appearance on 10 October 1802 of the <i><a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_Review" title="Edinburgh Review">Edinburgh Review</a></i>.
</p><p>At the outset the <i>Review</i> did not have an editor. The first three numbers were effectively edited by Sydney Smith.  On his leaving for England the work devolved chiefly on Jeffrey, who, by an arrangement with <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Constable" title="Archibald Constable">Archibald Constable</a>, the publisher, was eventually appointed editor at a fixed salary. Most of those involved were Whigs; but, although the general bias of the <i>Review</i> was towards social and political reforms, it was at first so little of a party organ that it numbered Sir <a href="/wiki/Walter_Scott" title="Walter Scott">Walter Scott</a> among its contributors; and no distinct emphasis was given to its political leanings until the publication in 1808 of an article by Jeffrey himself on the work of <i>Don Pedro Cevallos on the French Usurpation of Spain</i>. This article expressed despair of the success of the British arms in Spain, and Scott at once withdrew his subscription, the <i>Quarterly</i> being soon afterwards started in opposition. According to Lord Cockburn the effect of the first number of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> was "electrical." The English reviews were at that time practically publishers' organs, with articles by hack writers instructed to obey the publishers' interests. The <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, on the other hand, enlisted a brilliant and independent staff of contributors, guided by the editor, not the publisher. They received sixteen guineas a sheet (sixteen printed pages), increased subsequently to twenty-five guineas in many cases, instead of the two guineas earned by London reviewers. The review was not limited to literary criticism but became the accredited organ of moderate Whig public opinion. The particular work which provided the starting-point of an article was in many cases merely the occasion for the exposition, always brilliant and incisive, of the author's views on politics, social subjects, ethics or literature. These general principles and the novelty of the method ensured the success of the undertaking even after the original circle of exceptionally able men who founded it had been dispersed. It had a circulation of 12,000. Jeffrey's editorship lasted about twenty-six years, ceasing with the ninety-eighth number, published in June 1829, when he resigned in favour of <a href="/wiki/Macvey_Napier" title="Macvey Napier">Macvey Napier</a>.
</p><p>Jeffrey's own contributions numbered two hundred, all except six being written before his resignation of the editorship. He wrote quickly, at odd moments of leisure and with little special preparation. Great fluency and ease of diction, considerable warmth of imagination and moral sentiment, and a sharp eye to discover any oddity of style or violation of the accepted canons of good taste, made his criticisms pungent and effective. But the essential narrowness and timidity of his general outlook prevented him from detecting and estimating latent forces, either in politics or in matters strictly intellectual and moral; and this lack of understanding and sympathy accounts for his distrust and dislike of the passion and fancy of <a href="/wiki/Percy_Bysshe_Shelley" title="Percy Bysshe Shelley">Shelley</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Keats" title="John Keats">Keats</a>, and for his praise of the half-hearted and elegant <a href="/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">romanticism</a> of <a href="/wiki/Samuel_Rogers" title="Samuel Rogers">Samuel Rogers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Campbell_(poet)" title="Thomas Campbell (poet)">Thomas Campbell</a>.
</p><p>A criticism in the sixteenth number of the <i>Review</i> on the morality of <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Moore" title="Thomas Moore">Thomas Moore</a>'s poems led in 1806 to a duel between the two authors at <a href="/wiki/Chalk_Farm" title="Chalk Farm">Chalk Farm</a>. The proceedings were stopped by the police, and Jeffrey's pistol was found to contain no bullet. The affair led to a warm friendship, and Moore contributed to the Review, while Jeffrey made ample amends in a later article on <i><a href="/wiki/Lalla_Rookh" title="Lalla Rookh" class="mw-redirect">Lalla Rookh</a></i> (1817).
</p><p>Jeffrey's wife had died in 1805, and in 1810 he became acquainted with Charlotte, daughter of Charles Wilkes of New York, and great-niece of <a href="/wiki/John_Wilkes" title="John Wilkes">John Wilkes</a>. When she returned to the United States, Jeffrey followed her, and they were married in 1813. Before returning to Scotland, they visited several of the chief American cities, and his experience strengthened Jeffrey in the conciliatory policy he had advocated towards the States.
</p><p>Notwithstanding the increasing success of the <i>Review</i>, Jeffrey continued to look to the bar as the chief field of his ambition.  His literary reputation helped his professional advancement. His practice extended rapidly in the civil and criminal courts, and he regularly appeared before the general assembly of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scotland" title="Church of Scotland">Church of Scotland</a>.  As an advocate his sharpness and rapidity of insight gave him a formidable advantage in the detection of the weaknesses of a witness and the vulnerable points of his opponent's case, while he grouped his own arguments with an admirable eye to effect, especially excelling in eloquent closing appeals to a jury. Jeffrey was twice, in 1820 and 1822, elected <a href="/wiki/Rector_of_the_University_of_Glasgow" title="Rector of the University of Glasgow">Rector of the University of Glasgow</a>. In 1829 he was chosen dean of the <a href="/wiki/Faculty_of_Advocates" title="Faculty of Advocates">Faculty of Advocates</a>. On the return of the Whigs to power in 1830 he became <a href="/wiki/Lord_Advocate" title="Lord Advocate">Lord Advocate</a>, and entered parliament at a by-election in January 1831 as member for the <a href="/wiki/Perth_Burghs_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Perth Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)">Perth burghs</a>. The election was overturned on <a href="/wiki/Election_petition" title="Election petition">petition</a>, and in March he was returned at a by-election for <a href="/wiki/Malton_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Malton (UK Parliament constituency)">Malton</a>, a borough in the interest of <a href="/wiki/William_Fitzwilliam,_4th_Earl_Fitzwilliam" title="William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam">Lord Fitzwilliam</a>. He was re-elected in Malton at the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1831" title="United Kingdom general election, 1831">general election in May 1831</a>, but was also returned for the <a href="/wiki/Perth_Burghs_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Perth Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)">Perth burghs</a> and chose to sit for the latter. After the passing of the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Act_1832#Scotland" title="Reform Act 1832">Scottish Reform Bill</a>, which he introduced in parliament, he was returned for <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Edinburgh (UK Parliament constituency)">Edinburgh</a> in December 1832. At this time he was living at 24 Moray Place in the west end of <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>
