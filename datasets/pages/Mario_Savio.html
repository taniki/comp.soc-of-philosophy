<p>Savio was born in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> to a Sicilian-born Italian-American father who designed and manufactured restaurant equipment. Mario's mother was also of Italian ancestry, though born in the US, and worked as a retail salesperson.

<p>During the summer of 1964, he joined the <a href="/wiki/Freedom_Summer" title="Freedom Summer">Freedom Summer</a> projects in Mississippi and was involved in helping <a href="/wiki/African_Americans" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> register to vote.<sup id="cite_ref-Mowatt_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mowatt-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> He also taught at a freedom school for black children in <a href="/wiki/McComb,_Mississippi" title="McComb, Mississippi">McComb, Mississippi</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Rorabaugh21_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Rorabaugh21-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> In July, Savio, another white civil-rights activist and a black acquaintance were walking down a road in Jackson and were attacked by two men.

</p><p>When Savio returned to Berkeley after his time in Mississippi, he intended to raise money for <a href="/wiki/Student_Nonviolent_Coordinating_Committee" title="Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee">SNCC</a>, but found that the university had banned all political activity and fundraising.<sup id="cite_ref-Mowatt_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Mowatt-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> He told Karlyn Barker in 1964 that it was a question as to whose side one was on. "Are we on the side of the civil rights movement?

Well, we couldn’t forget."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Savio's part in the protest on the Berkeley campus started on October 1, 1964, when former graduate student <a href="/wiki/Jack_Weinberg" title="Jack Weinberg">Jack Weinberg</a> was manning a table for the <a href="/wiki/Congress_of_Racial_Equality" title="Congress of Racial Equality">Congress of Racial Equality</a> (CORE).

There, Savio gave his most famous speech, on the "operation of the machine", in front of 4,000 people. He and 800 others were arrested that day. In 1967, he was sentenced to 120 days at <a href="/wiki/Santa_Rita_Jail" title="Santa Rita Jail">Santa Rita Jail</a>.

<p>Also known as "Operation of the Machine," this speech is possibly Savio's most known work. Speaking on the steps of <a href="/wiki/Sproul_Hall" title="Sproul Hall" class="mw-redirect">Sproul Hall</a>, on December 2, 1964:
</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">We were told the following: If President Kerr actually tried to get something more liberal out of the regents in his telephone conversation, why didn't he make some public statement to that effect? And the answer we received, from a well-meaning liberal, was the following: He said, 'Would you ever imagine the manager of a firm making a statement publicly in opposition to his board of directors?' That's the answer!
<p>Well, I ask you to consider: If this is a firm, and if the board of regents are the board of directors; and if President Kerr in fact is the manager; then I'll tell you something. The faculty are a bunch of employees, and we're the raw material! But we're a bunch of raw materials that don't mean to be—have any process upon us. Don't mean to be made into any product. Don't mean… Don't mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We're human beings!
</p><p>There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part! You can't even passively take part! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels…upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all! <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In 1999, the media revealed that Savio had been tailed by the FBI from the moment that he had climbed onto the police car in which Jack Weinberg was detained. He was followed for more than a decade "because he had emerged as the nation's most prominent student leader".<sup id="cite_ref-RosenfeldSFC_2-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RosenfeldSFC-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> There was no evidence that he was a threat or that he had any connection with the <a href="/wiki/CPUSA" title="CPUSA" class="mw-redirect">Communist Party</a>, but the FBI decided he merited their attention because they thought he could inspire students to rebel.<sup id="cite_ref-RosenfeldSFC_2-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RosenfeldSFC-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Even after he had left the FSM, the FBI called him to their Berkeley office. They told Savio that they had received letters of a threatening nature towards him, but they would not speak with Savio's attorney present. However, Savio would not agree, and instead criticized the FBI "for failure to make arrests and take action in the South where <a href="/wiki/Human_rights" title="Human rights">human rights</a> are being violated every day."<sup id="cite_ref-RosenfeldSFC_2-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RosenfeldSFC-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> At this point the meeting ended.
</p><p>According to hundreds of pages of FBI files, the bureau:
</p>
<ul><li>Collected, without court order, personal information about Savio from schools, telephone companies, utility firms and banks and compiled information about his marriage and divorce.</li>
<li>Monitored his day-to-day activities by using informants planted in political groups, covertly contacting his neighbors, landlords and employers, and having agents pose as professors, journalists and activists to interview him and his wife.</li>
<li>Obtained his tax returns from the <a href="/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service" title="Internal Revenue Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> in violation of federal rules, mischaracterized him as a threat to the president and arranged for the <a href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA" class="mw-redirect">CIA</a> and foreign intelligence agencies to investigate him when he and his family travelled in Europe.</li>
<li>Put him on an unauthorized list of people to be detained without judicial warrant in the event of a national emergency, and designated him as a "Key Activist" whose political activities should be "disrupted" and "neutralized" under the bureau's illegal counterintelligence program known as <a href="/wiki/COINTELPRO" title="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>The investigation finally ended at the beginning of 1975 and at that point an investigation into the FBI's abuse of power began. Savio's ex-wife, Suzanne Goldberg, said that the "FBI's investigation of her and Savio [was] a waste of money and an invasion of privacy."<sup id="cite_ref-RosenfeldSFC_2-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-RosenfeldSFC-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>
