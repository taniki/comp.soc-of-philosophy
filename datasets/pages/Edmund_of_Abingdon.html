<p>Edmund was born on 20 November, circa 1180, in <a href="/wiki/Abingdon,_Oxfordshire" title="Abingdon, Oxfordshire" class="mw-redirect">Abingdon</a> in Berkshire (now <a href="/wiki/Oxfordshire" title="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a>), 7 miles south of <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, England.<sup id="cite_ref-edmonds_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-edmonds-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> It was the feast of St. <a href="/wiki/Edmund_the_Martyr" title="Edmund the Martyr">Edmund the Martyr</a>, so he was given the name Edmund. He was the oldest of four children.
</p><p>"Rich" was an epithet sometimes given to his wealthy merchant father. It was never applied to Edmund or his siblings in their lifetimes. Edmund may have been educated at the monastic school in <a href="/wiki/Abingdon_Abbey" title="Abingdon Abbey">Abingdon</a>. His early studies were in England, but he completed his higher learning in France at the University of Paris. About 1195, in company with his brother Richard, he was sent to the schools of Paris. He studied at the <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University" class="mw-redirect">universities of Oxford</a> and <a href="/wiki/University_of_Paris" title="University of Paris">Paris</a> and became a teacher about 1200, or a little earlier. For six years he lectured on <a href="/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dialectics" title="Dialectics" class="mw-redirect">dialectics</a>, apparently dividing his time between Oxford and Paris, and helped introduce the study of <a href="/wiki/Aristotle" title="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>.
</p><p>Edmund became one of Oxford's first lecturers with a Master of Arts, but was not Oxford's first Doctor of Divinity.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> and must have been something of a character in the eyes of the students. Long hours at night spent in prayer had the result that he often 'nodded off' during his lectures. There is a long-established tradition that he utilised his lecture-fees to build the Lady Chapel of St Peter's in the East at Oxford.<sup id="cite_ref-dover_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dover-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> The site where he lived and taught was formed into a mediaeval academic hall in his name and eventually incorporated as the current college <a href="/wiki/St_Edmund_Hall,_Oxford" title="St Edmund Hall, Oxford">St Edmund Hall</a>. His mother influenced him towards self-denial and austerity; and this led to his taking up the study of <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theology</a>.
</p><p>Though for some time Edmund resisted the change, he finally entered upon his new career between 1205 and 1210. He received ordination, took a doctorate in divinity and soon became known as a lecturer on theology and as an extemporaneous preacher. Some time between 1219 and 1222 he was appointed vicar of the parish of Calne in Wiltshire and treasurer of <a href="/wiki/Salisbury_Cathedral" title="Salisbury Cathedral">Salisbury Cathedral</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>   He held this position for eleven years, during which time he also engaged in preaching. In 1227 he preached the <a href="/wiki/Sixth_crusade" title="Sixth crusade" class="mw-redirect">sixth crusade</a> through a large part of England.<sup id="cite_ref-edmonds_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-edmonds-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>

<p>In 1233 came the news of Edmund's appointment, by <a href="/wiki/Pope_Gregory_IX" title="Pope Gregory IX">Pope Gregory IX</a>, to the Archbishopric of Canterbury. The chapter had already made three selections which the pope had declined to confirm.  Edmund's name had been proposed as a compromise by Gregory, perhaps on account of his work for the crusade.  He was consecrated on 2 April 1234.<sup id="cite_ref-Handbook233_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Handbook233-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Before his consecration Edmund became known for supporting ecclesiastical independence from Rome, maintenance of the <a href="/wiki/Magna_Carta" title="Magna Carta">Magna Carta</a> and the exclusion of foreigners from civil and ecclesiastical office. Reluctant to accept appointment as archbishop, Edmund was persuaded when it was pointed out that if he refused, the Pope might very well appoint a foreign ecclesiastic.<sup id="cite_ref-dover_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dover-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> He chose as his chancellor Richard of Wich, known to later ages as St Richard of Chichester.
</p><p>In the name of his fellow bishops Edmund admonished <a href="/wiki/Henry_III_of_England" title="Henry III of England">Henry III of England</a> at <a href="/wiki/Westminster" title="Westminster">Westminster</a>, on 2 February 1234, to heed the example of his father, <a href="/wiki/John_of_England" title="John of England" class="mw-redirect">John of England</a>. A week after his consecration he again appeared before the king with the barons and bishops, this time threatening Henry with excommunication if he refused to dismiss his councillors, particularly <a href="/wiki/Peter_des_Roches" title="Peter des Roches">Peter des Roches</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bishop_of_Winchester" title="Bishop of Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>. Henry yielded, and the favourites were dismissed, <a href="/wiki/Hubert_de_Burgh" title="Hubert de Burgh" class="mw-redirect">Hubert de Burgh</a> (whom they had imprisoned) was released and reconciled to the king and soon the archbishop was sent to <a href="/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Wales</a> to negotiate peace with <a href="/wiki/Llywelyn_the_Great" title="Llywelyn the Great">Llywelyn the Great</a>. Edmund's success, however, turned the king against him.<sup id="cite_ref-dover_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-dover-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Edmund was valued by the local people for his teaching, preaching, study, and his prayer; but his uncompromising stand in favour of good discipline in both civil and ecclesial government, of strict observance in monastic life, and of justice in high quarters brought him into conflict with Henry III, with several monasteries, and with the priests of Canterbury cathedral.<sup id="cite_ref-millwall_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-millwall-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> He claimed and exercised metropolitan rights of visitation, this was often challenged and he had to resort to litigation to maintain his authority, not the least with his own monastic chapter at Canterbury.<sup id="cite_ref-hayward_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-hayward-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Notwithstanding the gentleness of his disposition, Edmund firmly defended the rights of Church and State against the exactions and usurpations of Henry III. In December 1237 Edmund set out for Rome to plead his cause in person.<sup id="cite_ref-edmonds_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-edmonds-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> From this futile mission he returned to England in August 1238 where his efforts to foster reform were frustrated. Edmund submitted to the papal demands and, early in 1240 paid to the pope's agents one fifth of his revenue, which had been levied for the pope's war against <a href="/wiki/Emperor_Frederick_II" title="Emperor Frederick II" class="mw-redirect">Emperor Frederick II</a>.  Other English prelates followed his example.
</p><p>The papacy then ordered that 300 English benefices should be assigned to Romans. In 1240 Edmund set out for Rome. At the <a href="/wiki/Cistercian" title="Cistercian" class="mw-redirect">Cistercian</a> <a href="/wiki/Pontigny_Abbey" title="Pontigny Abbey">Pontigny Abbey</a> in France he became sick, began travelling back to England, but died only 50 miles further north, on 16 November 1240,<sup id="cite_ref-Handbook233_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Handbook233-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> at the house of <a href="/wiki/Augustinian_Canons" title="Augustinian Canons" class="mw-redirect">Augustinian Canons</a> at <a href="/wiki/Soisy-Bouy" title="Soisy-Bouy">Soisy-Bouy</a> and was taken back to Pontigny.
