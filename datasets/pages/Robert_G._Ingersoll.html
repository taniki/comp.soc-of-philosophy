<p>Robert Ingersoll was born in <a href="/wiki/Dresden,_Yates_County,_New_York" title="Dresden, Yates County, New York">Dresden, New York</a>. His father, <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_Ingersoll&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John Ingersoll (page does not exist)">John Ingersoll</a>, was an <a href="/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States" title="Abolitionism in the United States">abolitionist</a>-leaning <a href="/wiki/Congregationalist" title="Congregationalist" class="mw-redirect">Congregationalist</a> preacher, whose radical views forced his family to move frequently. For a time, Rev. John Ingersoll filled the <a href="/wiki/Pulpit" title="Pulpit">pulpit</a> for American revivalist <a href="/wiki/Charles_Grandison_Finney" title="Charles Grandison Finney">Charles G. Finney</a> while Finney was on a tour of Europe. Upon Finney's return, Rev. Ingersoll remained for a few months as co-pastor/associate pastor under Finney. The elder Ingersoll's later pastoral experiences influenced young Robert negatively, however, as The Elmira Telegram described in 1890: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.crookedlakereview.com/articles/34_66/41aug1991/41wilson.html">[1]</a>
</p>
<blockquote>Though for many years the most noted of American infidels, Colonel Ingersoll was born and reared in a devoutly Christian household. His father, John Ingersoll, was a Congregationalist minister and a man of mark in his time, a deep thinker, a logical and eloquent speaker, broad minded and generously tolerant of the views of others. The popular impression which credits Ingersoll's infidelity in the main to his father's severe orthodoxy and the austere and gloomy surroundings in which his boyhood was spent is wholly wrong. On the contrary the elder Ingersoll's liberal views were a source of constant trouble between him and his narrow-minded parishioners. They caused him to frequently change his charges, and several times made him the defendant in church trials. His ministerial career was, in fact, substantially brought to a close by a church trial which occurred while he was pastor of the Congregational Church at Madison, Ohio, and at which his third wife appeared as prosecutor. Upon this occasion he was charged with prevarication and unministerial conduct. The evidence adduced—the trial is one of the abiding traditions of the dull little town of Madison—was of the most trivial and ridiculous character, but the committee which heard it decided that though he had done "nothing inconsistent with his Christian character," he was "inconsistent with his ministerial character," and forbade him to preach in the future. Elder John went before the higher church authorities and was permitted to continue his clerical labors. However, he soon removed to Wisconsin, going from there to Illinois, where he died. The Madison trial occurred when young Robert was nine years old, and it was the unjust and bigoted treatment his father received which made him the enemy, first of Calvinism, and later of Christianity in its other forms.</blockquote>
<p>In 1853, "Bob" Ingersoll taught a term of school in <a href="/wiki/Metropolis,_Illinois" title="Metropolis, Illinois">Metropolis, Illinois</a>, where he let one of his students, the future Judge <a href="/w/index.php?title=Angus_M._L._McBane&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Angus M. L. McBane (page does not exist)">Angus M. L. McBane</a>, do the "greater part of the teaching, while Latin and history occupied his own attention".

</p><p>Later that year, the family settled in <a href="/wiki/Marion,_Illinois" title="Marion, Illinois">Marion, Illinois</a>, where Robert and his brother <a href="/wiki/Ebon_Clarke_Ingersoll" title="Ebon Clarke Ingersoll" class="mw-redirect">Ebon Clarke Ingersoll</a> were admitted to the bar in 1854. A county historian writing 22 years later noted that local residents considered the Ingersolls as a "very intellectual family; but, being Abolitionists, and the boys being <a href="/wiki/Deists" title="Deists" class="mw-redirect">deists</a>, rendered obnoxious to our people in that respect."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>While in Marion, he studied law under Judge <a href="/wiki/Willis_Allen" title="Willis Allen">Willis Allen</a> and served as deputy clerk for <a href="/w/index.php?title=John_M._Cunningham&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="John M.

In 1855, after Cunningham was named registrar for the federal land office in southeastern Illinois at <a href="/wiki/Old_Shawneetown,_Illinois" title="Old Shawneetown, Illinois">Shawneetown, Illinois</a>, Ingersoll followed him to the riverfront city along the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a>.

</p><p>As the trial of Hall's assassin dominated the scene and with his earlier mentor Cunningham having moved back to Marion following the land office's closing in 1856, and Logan's move to <a href="/wiki/Benton,_Illinois" title="Benton, Illinois">Benton, Illinois</a>, after his marriage that fall, Ingersoll and his brother moved to <a href="/wiki/Peoria,_Illinois" title="Peoria, Illinois">Peoria, Illinois</a>, where they finally settled in 1857.
</p><p>Ingersoll was married, February 13, 1862, to <a href="/w/index.php?title=Eva_Amelia_Parker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Eva Amelia Parker (page does not exist)">Eva Amelia Parker</a> (1841-1923).

</p><p>With the outbreak of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, he raised the <a href="/wiki/11th_Regiment_Illinois_Volunteer_Cavalry" title="11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry">11th Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry</a> and took command. The regiment fought in the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh" title="Battle of Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. Ingersoll was later captured as a result of a <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union</a> skirmish with the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America_Army" title="Confederate States of America Army" class="mw-redirect">Confederates</a> near <a href="/wiki/Lexington,_Tennessee" title="Lexington, Tennessee">Lexington, Tennessee</a> on December 18, 1862, then released on his promise that he would not fight again (he resigned as regiment commander on June 30, 1863), which was common practice early in the war.
</p><p>After the war, he served as <a href="/wiki/Illinois_Attorney_General" title="Illinois Attorney General">Illinois Attorney General</a>. He was a prominent member of the <a href="/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican Party</a> and, though he never held an elected position, he was nonetheless an active participant in politics. According to <a href="/wiki/Robert_Nisbet" title="Robert Nisbet">Robert Nisbet</a>, Ingersoll was a "staunch conservative Republican."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> His speech nominating <a href="/wiki/James_Blaine" title="James Blaine" class="mw-redirect">James G.

</p><p>Ingersoll was involved in several prominent trials as an attorney, notably the <a href="/wiki/Star_routes" title="Star routes">Star Route</a> trials, a major political scandal in which his clients were acquitted.

</p><p>Many of Ingersoll's speeches advocated <a href="/wiki/Freethought" title="Freethought">freethought</a> and <a href="/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, and often poked fun at religious belief. For this the press often attacked him, but neither his views nor the negative press could stop his rising popularity. At the height of Ingersoll's fame, audiences would pay $1 or more to hear him speak, a giant sum for his day.
</p><p>In a lecture entitled "The Great Infidels", he attacked the Christian doctrine of Hell: "All the meanness, all the revenge, all the selfishness, all the cruelty, all the hatred, all the infamy of which the heart of man is capable, grew blossomed, and bore fruit in this one word—Hell."<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Ingersoll died from <a href="/wiki/Congestive_heart_failure" title="Congestive heart failure" class="mw-redirect">congestive heart failure</a> at the age of 65.
