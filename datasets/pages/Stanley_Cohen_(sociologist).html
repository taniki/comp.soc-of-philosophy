<p>Cohen's 1972 study (<i>Folk Devils and Moral Panics</i>) of the UK <a href="/wiki/Popular_media" title="Popular media" class="mw-redirect">popular media</a> and social reaction to the Mods and Rockers phenomenon is widely regarded by British criminologists as one of the most influential works in the field in the last forty years. The work applied the concepts of labelling, societal reaction<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> and the notion of the <a href="/wiki/Deviancy_Amplification_Spiral" title="Deviancy Amplification Spiral" class="mw-redirect">Deviancy Amplification Spiral</a>. It helped to shift the focus of Criminology away from the causes of crime towards social reaction, the sociology of crime and <a href="/wiki/Social_Control" title="Social Control" class="mw-redirect">Social Control</a>. Cohen suggested the media overreact to an aspect of behaviour which may be seen as a challenge to existing social norms. However, the media response and representation of that behaviour actually helps to define it, communicate it and portrays it as a model for outsiders to observe and adopt. So the <a href="/wiki/Moral_panic" title="Moral panic">moral panic</a> by society represented in the media arguably fuels further socially unacceptable behaviour.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
Although Cohen is credited with coining the term <i>moral panic</i> the term is quite old - for instance an early usage can be found in the Quarterly Christian Spectator in 1830<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> and it was used by the Canadian communications theorist <a href="/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan" title="Marshall McLuhan">Marshall McLuhan</a> in 1964.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

<p>Cohen's last book <i>States Of Denial: Knowing about Atrocities and Suffering</i> attempts to analyze personal and political ways in which humans avoid uncomfortable realities, like poverty, suffering, injustice. In 11 chapters he examines elementary forms of denial, Knowing and Not-Knowing: The Psychology of Denial (How could people simultaneously know and not know about such matters?), Denial at Work: Mechanisms and Rhetorical Devices, Accounting for Atrocities: Perpetrators and Officials, Blocking Out the Past: Personal Memories, Public Histories, Bystander States (Though ignorance is bliss, to what extent is a bystander a perpetrator?, Images of Suffering, Appeals: Outrage Into Action, Digging Up Graves, Opening Wounds: Acknowledging the Past, Acknowledgement Now (societal and personal transformation) and concludes with Loose Ends. <sup id="cite_ref-pol_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pol-7">[7]</a></sup> 
</p><p>The book has been highly praised by reviewers in the English speaking world. The Guardian wrote, "He leads the reader to the conclusion that it is denial that is "normal" and an ability to see the truth and act accordingly which is rare, whether in individuals or in governments." <a href="/wiki/Michael_Ignatieff" title="Michael Ignatieff">Michael Ignatieff</a> said "this book will become the starting point for all future debate on the subject".<sup id="cite_ref-pol_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pol-7">[7]</a></sup>

He writes how it seems as if these people only want to signify and realize things that they want, not actual reality. He says that people do know yet do not know that there is suffering and oppression, as if they choose to ignore it rather than talk about such an uneasy topic. Many people assume, and sometimes witness these acts occur, yet when asked will deny anything ever happened. Stanley Cohen writes about how people act blind to reality, due to uncomfortable and uneasy topics. According to Cohen, many people are in touch with the fact that racial oppression still occurs, along with other acts of human suffering, yet deny that those actions happen. The topic of racial oppression being such an uncomfortable topic makes it hard for many to acknowledge that it actually happens to this day. Stanley Cohen’s point of the book is to bring awareness to those who do not see the truth being <a href="/wiki/Mass_incarceration" title="Mass incarceration" class="mw-redirect">mass incarceration</a> and how society is structured. He wants people to realize how much people choose to ignore in society today, and that it needs to change.
