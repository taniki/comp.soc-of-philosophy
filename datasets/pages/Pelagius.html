Pelagius denied Augustine's theory of <a href="/wiki/Original_sin" title="Original sin">original sin</a>. His adherents cited Deuteronomy 24:16 in support of their position.

His reputation earned him praise early in his career even from such pillars of the Church as Augustine, who referred to him as a "saintly man".

<p>Pelagius was born about 354-360. He is said by his contemporaries, such as Augustine of Hippo, <a href="/wiki/Prosper_of_Aquitaine" title="Prosper of Aquitaine">Prosper of Aquitaine</a>, <a href="/wiki/Marius_Mercator" title="Marius Mercator">Marius Mercator</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Orosius" title="Orosius">Paul Orosius</a>, to have been of British origin.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Jerome" title="Jerome">Jerome</a> apparently thought that Pelagius was Irish, suggesting that he was "stuffed with Irish porridge" (<i>Scotorum pultibus praegravatus</i>).<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup> Tall in stature and portly in appearance, Pelagius was highly educated.

</p><p>Pelagius became better known around 380 when he moved to Rome.<sup id="cite_ref-Fletcher_11_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Fletcher_11-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup> There he enjoyed a reputation of austerity; he also corresponded with St. <a href="/wiki/Paulinus_of_Nola" title="Paulinus of Nola">Paulinus of Nola</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-pohle_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pohle-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Pelagius became concerned about the moral laxity of society.

<p>Pelagianism quickly spread, especially around Carthage.  Augustine wrote "<i>De peccatorum meritis et remissione</i> libri III" (Three Books on the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins) in 412, and "<i>De spiritu et littera</i>" (On the Spirit and the Letter) in 414. When in 414 disquieting rumours arrived from Sicily and the so-called "Definitiones Caelestii", said to be the work of Caelestius, were sent to him, he at once (414 or 415) published the rejoinder, "De perfectione justitiae hominis". In these, he strongly affirmed the existence of original sin, the need for infant baptism, the impossibility of a sinless life without Christ, and the necessity of Christ's grace. Augustine's works are intended in part for the common people, thus do not address Pelagius or his disciple Caelestius by name.<sup id="cite_ref-pohle_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pohle-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Pelagius soon left for Palestine, befriending the bishop there.  Jerome, who lived there, became involved, as well.  Pelagius had criticized his commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians.<sup id="cite_ref-pohle_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-pohle-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup> Jerome wrote against Pelagius in his "<i>Letter to Ctesiphon</i>" and "<i>Dialogus contra Pelagianos</i>."  With Jerome at the time was <a href="/wiki/Paulus_Orosius" title="Paulus Orosius" class="mw-redirect">Orosius</a>, a visiting pupil of Augustine, with similar views on the dangers of Pelagianism.  Together, they publicly condemned Pelagius.  Bishop <a href="/wiki/John_II,_Bishop_of_Jerusalem" title="John II, Bishop of Jerusalem">John of Jerusalem</a>, a personal friend of Pelagius, called a council in July 415.  Church sources claim Orosius' lack of fluency in Greek rendered him unconvincing and John's Eastern background made him more willing to accept that humans did not have inherent sinfulness, yet the council rendered no verdict and passed the controversy to the Latin Church because Pelagius, Jerome, and Orosius were all Latin.

<p>A few months later in December of 415, another synod in <a href="/wiki/Lod" title="Lod">Diospolis</a> (Lydda) under the bishop of Cæsarea was called by two deposed bishops who came to the Holy Land.  However, neither bishop attended for unrelated reasons and Orosius had left after consultation with Bishop John.  Pelagius explained to the synod that he did believe God was necessary for salvation because every human is created by God. He also claimed that many works of <a href="/wiki/Celestius" title="Celestius" class="mw-redirect">Celestius</a> did not represent his own views.

<p>After his acquittal in Diospolis, Pelagius wrote two major treatises which are no longer extant, <i>On Nature</i> and <i>Defense of the Freedom of the Will</i>. In these, he defends his position on sin and sinlessness, and accuses Augustine of being under the influence of <a href="/wiki/Manichaeism" title="Manichaeism">Manichaeism</a> by elevating evil to the same status as God and teaching pagan fatalism as if it were a Christian doctrine.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>Manichaeism stressed that the spirit was God-created, while material substance was corrupt and evil. Theologian Gerald Bonner felt that part of Pelagius' analysis was an over-reaction to Manicheanism. Pelagius held that everything created by God was good, therefore, he could not see how God had made humans fallen creatures.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> (Augustine's teachings on the Fall of Adam was not a settled doctrine at the time the Augustinian/Pelagian dispute began.)
</p><p>Their view that mankind can avoid sinning, and that we can freely choose to obey God's commandments, stand at the core of Pelagian teaching. Pelagius stressed human autonomy and freedom of the will.<sup id="cite_ref-Filippo_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Filippo-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>An illustration of Pelagius' views on man's "moral ability" not to sin can be found in his "Letter to Demetrias".<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> He was in the Holy Land when, in 413, he received a letter from the renowned <a href="/wiki/Anicia_(gens)" title="Anicia (gens)">Anician</a> family in Rome. One of the aristocratic ladies who had been among his followers, Anicia Juliana, was writing to a number of eminent Western theologians, including Jerome and possibly Augustine, for moral advice for her 14-year-old daughter, <a href="/wiki/Demetrias_(daughter_of_Anicius_Hermogenianus_Olybrius)" title="Demetrias (daughter of Anicius Hermogenianus Olybrius)">Demetrias</a>.  Pelagius used the letter to argue his case for morality, stressing his views of natural sanctity and man's moral capacity to choose to live a holy life.  It is perhaps the only extant writing in Pelagius' own hand, and it was, ironically, thought to be a letter by Jerome for centuries, though Augustine himself references it in his work, <i>On the Grace of Christ</i>.

<p>For Pelagius, "grace" consisted of the gift of free will, the Law of Moses, and the teachings of Jesus.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> With these, a person would be able to perceive the moral course of action and follow it. Prayer, fasting, and asceticism supported the will to do good. Augustine accused Pelagius of thinking of God's grace as consisting only of external helps.
</p><p>Extant letters of Pelagius and his followers claim that all good works are done only with the grace of God (which he saw as enabling, but not forcing, good works), that infants must be baptized for salvation, and that the saints were not always sinless, but that some at least have been able to stop sinning.
</p><p>He instead said, "This grace we for our part do not, as you suppose, allow to consist merely in the law, but also in the help of God. God helps us by His teaching and revelation, whilst He opens the eyes of our heart; whilst He points out to us the future, that we may not be absorbed in the present; whilst He discovers to us the snares of the devil; whilst He enlightens us with the manifold and ineffable gift of heavenly grace." In a letter to the Pope defending himself, he stated, "This free will is in all good works always assisted by divine help," and in an accompanying confession of faith, "Free-will we do so own, as to say that we always stand in need of God’s help," However, he affirmed that "We do also abhor the blasphemy of those who say that any impossible thing is commanded to man by God; or that the commandments of God cannot be performed by any one man" (which the pope approved of upon receiving the letter), whereas Augustine famously stated "<i>non possum non peccare</i>" ("I cannot not sin").

<p>Pelagius' guilt in the eyes of the Church, however, was undecided. Pelagius wrote a letter and statement of belief showing himself to be orthodox and sent them to Innocent I.

<p>An objective view of Pelagius and his effect is difficult.  His name has been used as an epithet for centuries by both Protestants and Catholics, and he has had few defenders.  The very early church denounced his ideas and the Reformation accused Roman Catholics of adhering to his beliefs and condemned both Pelagius and the Catholic Church. Modern scholarship suggests that Pelagius did not take the more extreme positions later associated with his followers.<sup id="cite_ref-Clark_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Clark-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Ronald_Hutton" title="Ronald Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> describes him as "a first-rate theologian".<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup>
