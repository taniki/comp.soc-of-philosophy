<p>In 1976 Macpherson was criticized from both those on the left and the right. In response he claimed that what he had always been trying to do was to "work out a revision of liberal-democratic theory, a revision that clearly owed a great deal to Marx, in the hope of making that theory more democratic while rescuing that valuable part of the liberal tradition which is submerged when liberalism is identified as synonymous with capitalist market relations."<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup>  His combination of Marx's political economy with <a href="/wiki/T.H._Green" title="T.H.

<p>Macpherson's best-known contribution to political philosophy is the theory of "possessive individualism", in which an individual is conceived as the sole proprietor of his or her skills and owes nothing to society for them. These skills (and those of others) are a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market, and in such a society is demonstrated a selfish and unending thirst for consumption which is considered the crucial core of human nature.  Macpherson spent most of his career battling these premises, but perhaps the greatest single exposition of this view can be found in <i>The Political Theory of Possessive Individualism</i>, where Macpherson examines the function of this particular kind of individualism in <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes" title="Thomas Hobbes">Hobbes</a>, <a href="/wiki/James_Harrington_(author)" title="James Harrington (author)">Harrington</a> and <a href="/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">Locke</a> (and several writers in between, including the <a href="/wiki/Levellers" title="Levellers">Levellers</a>) and its resulting pervasiveness throughout most liberal literature of the period. An avowed socialist, he believed that this culture of possessive individualism prevented individuals from developing their powers of rationality, moral judgment, contemplation and even friendship and love.  These were the "truly human powers," Macpherson claimed.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Essay VII of the <i>Essays in Retrieval</i> was titled "Elegant Tombstones: A Note on Friedman's Freedom," and was a direct challenge to certain assumptions of "freedom" made by <a href="/wiki/Milton_Friedman" title="Milton Friedman">Milton Friedman</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/Capitalism_and_Freedom" title="Capitalism and Freedom">Capitalism and Freedom</a></i>.  For Macpherson, capitalism was discordant with freedom.  Part of the disagreement can be found in the differing interpretations of 'freedom.'  For self-described 'classical liberals' like Friedman, freedom is negative and is seen as an absence of constraints or freedom of choice.  Following a tradition that began with <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel">G.W.F. Hegel</a>, Macpherson viewed freedom as positive and defined it as the freedom to develop one's fullest human potential.
</p><p>Friedman shows great disdain for <a href="/wiki/Positive_liberty" title="Positive liberty">positive freedom</a>, associating it with <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>; he uses the term 'liberal' with derision when referring to socialists, while contesting that he was a true liberal.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  Macpherson's criticisms of Friedman rest on three claims: (1) an "error" that tarnishes Friedman's attempt to demonstrate that capitalism organizes the economic activities of society without coercion; (2) the "inadequacy" of his assertion that capitalism is a necessary component of freedom, and that socialism is inconsistent with freedom; and (3) the "fallacy" of his evidence that capitalism is an ethically sound principle of distribution.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Macpherson contends that the coercion in capitalism is that one cannot choose not to be a capitalist in a capitalist society. One can, of course, choose to change jobs, but one cannot choose <i>not</i> to work.  For the exchange to be truly voluntary "the proviso that is needed is whether to enter into any exchange at all." <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  The workers need money but cannot barter; therefore, they are coerced into the monetary system.  Furthermore, the voluntary nature of the exchange is only evident is cases of perfect competition where each product is the same and there are an infinite number of suppliers.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup> Also, Macpherson took issue with corporations as "individuals" in a capitalist society.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2011)">citation needed</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>For Friedman, <a href="/wiki/Economic_freedom" title="Economic freedom">economic freedom</a> needed to be protected because it ensured political freedom.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Friedman appeals to historical examples that demonstrate where the largest amount of political freedom is found the economic model has been capitalist. In Friedman's words, "history suggests...that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>  Macpherson counters that the 19th-century examples that Friedman uses actually show that political freedom came first and those who gained this freedom, mainly property owning elites, used this new political freedom for their own best interests which meant to open the doors to unrestrained capitalism. It follows then, that capitalism will only be maintained as long as those who have political freedom deem it worthwhile. As the 19th century progressed and suffrage was expanded, there were corresponding restraints placed upon capitalism which indicates that political freedom and capitalism are at odds with one another. "At any rate", Macpherson contends, this "historical correlation scarcely suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom."<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>Friedman also contended that where socialism links economics with politics, economics cannot act as a check on political power.  Macpherson countered that there is little evidence that economics does check political power. In fact, in many cases political power becomes subservient to economic power in the capitalist system.  In this regard, socialism allows a better check on economic power toward political power than the converse under capitalism.  Macpherson accuses Friedman of supplanting a Communist society for a Socialist one; at the very least Friedman does not differentiate between the two.
</p><p>Milton Friedman believed that, if most of the regulatory and welfare activities of Western states were discontinued, freedom would be advanced.  This is true if one follows the negative sense of freedom, but not so if one follows the positive version of Macpherson.  Essentially, Friedman, according to Macpherson, does not factor as sort of "ethical claims of equality" into his demand for freedom (that is, market freedom).<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> According to Macpherson, many of the "classical liberals" of previous centuries, which Friedman claims to represent, would have rejected this idea outright.
