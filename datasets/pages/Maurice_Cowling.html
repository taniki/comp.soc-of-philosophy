<p>Cowling was born in <a href="/wiki/West_Norwood" title="West Norwood">West Norwood</a>, South London, to a lower-middle-class family. His family then moved to <a href="/wiki/Streatham" title="Streatham">Streatham</a>, where Cowling attended an <a href="/wiki/London_County_Council" title="London County Council">LCC</a> elementary school, and from 1937 the <a href="/wiki/Battersea_Grammar_School" title="Battersea Grammar School">Battersea Grammar School</a>. When the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War" class="mw-redirect">Second World War</a> started in 1939 the school moved to <a href="/wiki/Worthing" title="Worthing">Worthing</a> and then from 1940 to <a href="/wiki/Hertford" title="Hertford">Hertford</a> where Cowling attended sixth-form.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1943 Cowling won a scholarship to <a href="/wiki/Jesus_College,_Cambridge" title="Jesus College, Cambridge">Jesus College, Cambridge</a>, but was called up for military service in September 1944, where he joined the <a href="/wiki/Queen%27s_Royal_Regiment" title="Queen's Royal Regiment" class="mw-redirect">Queen's Royal Regiment</a>. In 1945, after training and serving in a holding battalion, he was sent to <a href="/wiki/Bangalore" title="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> as an <a href="/wiki/Officer_cadet" title="Officer cadet">officer cadet</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1946 Cowling was attached to the <a href="/wiki/Kumaon_Regiment" title="Kumaon Regiment">Kumaon Regiment</a> and the next year-and-a-half he travelled to <a href="/wiki/Agra" title="Agra">Agra</a>, Razmak on the <a href="/wiki/North-West_Frontier_(military_history)" title="North-West Frontier (military history)" class="mw-redirect">North-West Frontier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Assam" title="Assam">Assam</a>. As independence for India neared in 1947, Cowling was dispatched to <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a> as a camp adjutant to the British HQ there. Cowling was then promoted to captain in <a href="/wiki/Libya" title="Libya">Libya</a>. By the end of 1947 Cowling was finally demobilised, and in 1948 he went back to Jesus College to complete his History <a href="/wiki/Tripos" title="Tripos">Tripos</a>, where he received a <a href="/wiki/Academic_degree" title="Academic degree">Double First</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Cowling later remembered that he fell in love with Cambridge.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> He toyed with the idea of being ordained and went to college chapel, possessing "a strong polemical Christianity". Of his religion, Cowling later claimed: "I'm not sure of the depth or reality of my religious conviction. It could well be that it was a polemical conviction against liberalism rather than a real conviction of the truth of Christianity...I suppose on a census I would describe myself as a member of the <a href="/wiki/Church_of_England" title="Church of England">Church of England</a>. If you ask me, do I think I ought to be an Anglican, the answer is that I probably ought to be a <a href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic" class="mw-redirect">Roman Catholic</a>, but I don't see any prospect of that happening...I have a very Protestant mind".<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1954 Cowling worked at the British <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Office" title="Foreign Office" class="mw-redirect">Foreign Office</a> for six months at the Jordan department, and in early 1955, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Times" title="The Times">The Times</a></i> gave him the job of foreign leader-writer, which he held for three years. In 1957 Cowling was invited by the Director of the <a href="/w/index.php?title=Conservative_Political_Centre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Conservative Political Centre (page does not exist)">Conservative Political Centre</a> to write a <a href="/wiki/Pamphlet" title="Pamphlet">pamphlet</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Suez_Crisis" title="Suez Crisis">Suez Crisis</a>; it was never published however, as the party wanted to move on from Suez as quickly as possible. He stood unsuccessfully for the parliamentary seat of <a href="/wiki/Bassetlaw_(UK_Parliament_constituency)" title="Bassetlaw (UK Parliament constituency)">Bassetlaw</a> during the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1959" title="United Kingdom general election, 1959">General Election of 1959</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)" title="Conservative Party (UK)">Conservative Party</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Cowling later said that "I enjoyed being a candidate, though it was very hard work and elections are like what I imagine having all your teeth out is like".<sup id="cite_ref-Attallah.2C_p._134_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Attallah.2C_p._134-7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>In 1961 Cowling was elected a Fellow of Jesus College and Director of Studies in Economics, shortly before the History Faculty appointed him to an Assistant Lectureship. Cowling's first book was <i>The Nature and Limits of Political Science</i>. Influenced by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Oakeshott" title="Michael Oakeshott">Michael Oakeshott</a>, this was an attack on political science and political philosophy as it was then taught. Cowling argued that social science's claim to have discovered how people behaved was false because politics was too complex and fluid to be rationalised by theorists and only fully intelligible to politicians.<sup id="cite_ref-ODNB_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ODNB-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>During six weeks of the summer of 1962 Cowling wrote <i>Mill and Liberalism</i>, which was published in 1963 and became one of his most contentious books.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The book claimed Mill was not as <a href="/wiki/Libertarianism" title="Libertarianism">libertarian</a> as he was traditionally portrayed, and that Mill resembled a "moral <a href="/wiki/Totalitarian" title="Totalitarian" class="mw-redirect">totalitarian</a>". Dr. Roland Hill reviewed the book in <i><a href="/wiki/Philosophical_Quarterly" title="Philosophical Quarterly" class="mw-redirect">Philosophical Quarterly</a></i> (January 1965) and called it "dangerous and unpleasant", with Cowling later remarking that this "was what it was intended to be".<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1963 he was elected a Fellow to <a href="/wiki/Peterhouse,_Cambridge" title="Peterhouse, Cambridge">Peterhouse, Cambridge</a>, where he advised his students to tackle liberals with "irony, geniality and malice". During the 1960s Cowling campaigned against a sociology course to be introduced at Cambridge, regarding it as a "vehicle for liberal dogma".<sup id="cite_ref-TimesObit_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TimesObit-11">[11]</a></sup> In November 1966 Cowling was elected as a Conservative <a href="/wiki/Councillor" title="Councillor">councillor</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Cambridgeshire_and_Isle_of_Ely_County_Council" title="Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council" class="mw-redirect">Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely County Council</a> in a by-election, which he held until 1970.<sup id="cite_ref-council_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-council-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>He was appointed the literary editor of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Spectator" title="The Spectator">The Spectator</a></i> from 1970 to 1971, and in the early 1970s he wrote articles of a broadly <a href="/wiki/Enoch_Powell" title="Enoch Powell">Powellite</a> nature arguing against the UK being a member of the <a href="/wiki/European_Community" title="European Community" class="mw-redirect">EEC</a>. Cowling resigned in 1971 when the editor acting in <a href="/wiki/George_Gale_(journalist)" title="George Gale (journalist)">George Gale</a>'s absence refused to publish Cowling's protest against his publication of an article by Tony Palmer which suggested that the important question about <a href="/wiki/Anne,_Princess_Royal" title="Anne, Princess Royal">The Princess Anne</a> was whether she was a virgin.<sup id="cite_ref-ODNB_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ODNB-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>It was on Cowling's suggestion that Paul Smith edited a collection of <a href="/wiki/Robert_Gascoyne-Cecil,_3rd_Marquess_of_Salisbury" title="Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>'s articles from the Quarterly Review, published in 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1977 <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher" title="Margaret Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> visited the Cambridge Graduate Conservative Association of Peterhouse where she "cut through the compact subtlety and 'rational pessimism' of [Cowling]" and sharply retorted: "We don't want pessimists in our party".<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> In 1978 he ceased to be Director of Studies in Peterhouse, and helped to found the Salisbury Group, a group of conservative thinkers named, on <a href="/wiki/Michael_Oakeshott" title="Michael Oakeshott">Michael Oakeshott</a>'s advice, after Lord Salisbury. In the same year Cowling published <i>Conservative Essays</i> where he said:
</p>
<blockquote>If there <i>is</i> a class war – and there is – it is important that it should be handled with subtlety and skill. ... it is not freedom that Conservatives want; what they want is the sort of freedom that will maintain existing inequalities or restore lost ones.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup></blockquote>
<p>Cowling was "instrumental" in getting the historian <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Trevor-Roper" title="Hugh Trevor-Roper">Hugh Trevor-Roper</a> from <a href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University" class="mw-redirect">Oxford</a> to become Master of Peterhouse from 1980 to 1987, though in later years he came to regret supporting Dacre's arrival there.<sup id="cite_ref-TimesObit_11-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-TimesObit-11">[11]</a></sup> In November 1989 Cowling published his essay on 'The Sources of the <a href="/wiki/New_Right" title="New Right">New Right</a>' in <i>Encounter</i> which detailed the ideological roots of <a href="/wiki/Thatcherism" title="Thatcherism">Thatcherism</a> Britain and became the Preface to the second edition of <i>Mill and Liberalism</i> in 1990. In 1990 Cowling described himself as "an intellectual <a href="/wiki/Thatcherite" title="Thatcherite" class="mw-redirect">Thatcherite</a>, just as I was an intellectual <a href="/wiki/Powellism" title="Powellism">Powellite</a>, and I think it is important that the Conservative party should be in good hands and that it should win elections...I am a warm supporter [of the Thatcher government]".<sup id="cite_ref-Attallah.2C_p._134_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Attallah.2C_p._134-7">[7]</a></sup> In Cowling's view "Liberalism is essentially the belief that there can be a reconciliation of all difficulties and differences, and since there can't, it is a misleading way to approach politics".<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> He regarded <a href="/wiki/Salman_Rushdie" title="Salman Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/The_Satanic_Verses" title="The Satanic Verses">The Satanic Verses</a></i> as "a nasty, sneering, free-thinking book...I can understand why the book is offensive and it didn't seem to me to be anything but offensive when I read it. Some thinking Moslems take a view of the nature of religion, and the incompatibility between Islam and liberalism, which runs parallel to what I'm saying in <i>Mill and Liberalism</i>".<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1992 Philip Williamson published his book on British politics from 1926 to 1932 and said Cowling "provided the original inspiration" for it.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup>

<p>Cowling retired from the History Faculty of Cambridge in 1988, and from his Fellowship of Peterhouse in 1993. In 1996, in Swansea, Cowling married <a href="/wiki/George_Gale_(journalist)" title="George Gale (journalist)">George Gale</a>'s ex-wife Patricia. In 2005 in Swansea,<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> Cowling died after a long illness.

<p>Cowling wrote three books on British high politics, the sequence he called <i>The Politics of British Democracy</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Cowling claimed that "In the future there will be an introduction bearing the sequence-title which will deal in its widest aspects with the period from 1850 to 1940 and will assess the methods used in the volumes which have now been published".<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> However this never appeared. Cowling wrote a letter to <i>The Times Literary Supplement</i> on 3 June 1977 claiming the need for "a different emphasis" to that on high politics.
</p><p>The first of these was his work on the <a href="/wiki/Reform_Act_1867" title="Reform Act 1867">Reform Act 1867</a>, published during its centenary and dedicated to "the Prime Minister", <a href="/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour</a> leader <a href="/wiki/Harold_Wilson" title="Harold Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>. Cowling challenged the traditional liberal assumptions over the reform crisis of the 1860s by claiming that the <a href="/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK)" title="Liberal Party (UK)">Liberal Party</a> was not the straightforward progressive party that wanted to hand political power to the working-class and that the Conservatives did not promote reform in reaction to working-class pressure. Cowling instead placed much more importance on parliamentary manoeuvres.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Robert_Blake,_Baron_Blake" title="Robert Blake, Baron Blake">Robert Blake</a> claimed that this book "gives the most convincing account of what happened".<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1971 appeared <i>The Impact of Labour</i>, which dealt with the years between 1920, after Labour won <a href="/wiki/Spen_Valley_by-election,_1919" title="Spen Valley by-election, 1919">the Spen Valley by-election</a>, and 1924 when the Conservatives won the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1924" title="United Kingdom general election, 1924">general election</a> of that year and ended the Liberal Party as a realistic party of government, with the Labour Party emerging as the Opposition.
</p><p>In 1975 appeared <i>The Impact of Hitler</i>, dealing with 1933 to 1940. Cowling was an "<a href="/wiki/Isolationist" title="Isolationist" class="mw-redirect">isolationist</a> <a href="/wiki/Imperialist" title="Imperialist" class="mw-redirect">imperialist</a>"<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup> who argued that from Britain's point of view the <a href="/wiki/Second_World_War" title="Second World War" class="mw-redirect">Second World War</a> was a "liberal war which had been entered into in a condition of moral indignation without the resources to fight it" and that it had been "providential good fortune which had placed the burden of fighting on the Russians and the Americans".<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> He disapproved of the fact that the war was followed by a Labour <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom_general_election,_1945" title="United Kingdom general election, 1945">electoral landslide</a>, a greatly expanded <a href="/wiki/Welfare_state" title="Welfare state">welfare state</a> and the liquidation of the <a href="/wiki/British_Empire" title="British Empire">British Empire</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The policy making process for Cowling is heavily influenced by party politics. Cowling was well known for his <i>Primat der Innenpolitik</i> ("primacy of domestic politics") explanations for British foreign policy; for example, he argued that the British "guarantee" of Poland issued on 31 March 1939 was advanced to improve the Conservatives' chances against Labour, and had nothing to do with foreign policy considerations.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup> Cowling's approach is the opposite of the <i>Primat der Außenpolitik</i> ("primacy of foreign politics") thesis.

<p>In 1980, 1985 and 2001 appeared the three volumes of Cowling's <i>Religion and Public Doctrine in Modern England</i>. The political history books required "tiring archival visits"; Cowling much preferred writing these. In researching for these books "He spent his days in his college rooms, muscularly grappling with books, indeed often physically ripping them apart. Made up of hundreds of essays on the thought of individuals, the work neither engaged with other scholarship nor developed an interpretative model for understanding modern Britain".<sup id="cite_ref-ODNB_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ODNB-8">[8]</a></sup> Cowling placed Christianity squarely at the centre of English culture post-1840 and claimed that anti-Christians more often than not held traditional religious assumptions and prejudices. Secularisation was not so fast or complete as had been previously argued, but "defenders of orthodoxy as well as their assailants were subjected to pithy, provocative irony" by Cowling.<sup id="cite_ref-ODNB_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ODNB-8">[8]</a></sup>
