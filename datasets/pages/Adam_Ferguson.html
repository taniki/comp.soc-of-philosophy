<p>Born at <a href="/wiki/Logierait" title="Logierait">Logierait</a> in <a href="/wiki/Atholl" title="Atholl">Atholl</a>, <a href="/wiki/Perthshire" title="Perthshire">Perthshire</a>, Scotland, he received his education  at Logierait Parish School, <a href="/wiki/Perth_Grammar_School" title="Perth Grammar School">Perth Grammar School</a>, and at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> and the <a href="/wiki/University_of_St_Andrews" title="University of St Andrews">University of St Andrews</a> (MA 1742).<sup id="cite_ref-Waterston_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Waterston-3">[3]</a></sup> In 1745, owing to his knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language" title="Scottish Gaelic language" class="mw-redirect">Gaelic</a>, he gained appointment as deputy <a href="/wiki/Chaplain" title="Chaplain">chaplain</a> of the 43rd (afterwards the 42nd) regiment (the <a href="/wiki/Black_Watch" title="Black Watch">Black Watch</a>), the licence to preach being granted him by special dispensation, although he had not completed the required six years of <a href="/wiki/Theology" title="Theology">theological</a> study.
</p><p>It remains a matter of debate as to whether, at the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Fontenoy" title="Battle of Fontenoy">Battle of Fontenoy</a> (1745), Ferguson fought in the ranks throughout the day, and refused to leave the field, though ordered to do so by his colonel. Nevertheless, he certainly did well, becoming principal chaplain in 1746. He continued attached to the regiment till 1754, when, disappointed at not obtaining a living, he left the clergy and resolved to devote himself to literary pursuits.
</p><p>After residing in <a href="/wiki/Leipzig" title="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> for a time, he returned to <a href="/wiki/Edinburgh" title="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> where in January 1757 he succeeded <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> as librarian to the <a href="/wiki/Faculty_of_Advocates" title="Faculty of Advocates">Faculty of Advocates</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Advocates%27_Library" title="Advocates' Library" class="mw-redirect">Advocates' Library</a>), but soon relinquished this office on becoming tutor in the family of the <a href="/wiki/Earl_of_Bute" title="Earl of Bute" class="mw-redirect">Earl of Bute</a>. In 1759 Ferguson became professor of <a href="/wiki/Natural_philosophy" title="Natural philosophy">natural philosophy</a> in the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh" title="University of Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a>, and in 1764 transferred to the chair of "pneumatics" (<a href="/wiki/Mental_philosophy" title="Mental philosophy" class="mw-redirect">mental philosophy</a>) "and <a href="/wiki/Moral_philosophy" title="Moral philosophy" class="mw-redirect">moral philosophy</a>".
</p><p>In 1767, he published his <i><a href="/wiki/Essay_on_the_History_of_Civil_Society" title="Essay on the History of Civil Society" class="mw-redirect">Essay on the History of Civil Society</a></i>, which was well received and translated into several <a href="/wiki/European_languages" title="European languages" class="mw-redirect">European languages</a>. In the mid-1770s he travelled again to the <a href="/wiki/European_mainland" title="European mainland" class="mw-redirect">Continent</a> and met <a href="/wiki/Voltaire" title="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>. His membership of <a href="/wiki/The_Poker_Club" title="The Poker Club">The Poker Club</a> is recorded in its minute book of 1776.
</p><p>In 1776 appeared his anonymous pamphlet on the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolution" title="American Revolution">American Revolution</a> in opposition to Dr <a href="/wiki/Richard_Price" title="Richard Price">Richard Price</a>'s <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Observations_on_the_Nature_of_Civil_Liberty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty (page does not exist)">Observations on the Nature of Civil Liberty</a></i>, in which he sympathised with the views of the <a href="/wiki/British_legislature" title="British legislature" class="mw-redirect">British legislature</a>. In 1778 Ferguson was appointed secretary to the <a href="/wiki/Carlisle_Peace_Commission" title="Carlisle Peace Commission">Carlisle Peace Commission</a> which endeavoured, but without success, to negotiate an arrangement with the revolted colonies.
</p><p>In 1780 he wrote the article "History" for the second edition of <a href="/wiki/Encyclopaedia_Britannica" title="Encyclopaedia Britannica" class="mw-redirect">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> The article is 40 pages long and replaced the article in the first edition, which was only one paragraph.
</p><p>In 1783 appeared his <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=History_of_the_Progress_and_Termination_of_the_Roman_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic (page does not exist)">History of the Progress and Termination of the Roman Republic</a></i>; it became very popular and went through several editions. Ferguson believed that the <a href="/wiki/History_of_the_Roman_Republic" title="History of the Roman Republic" class="mw-redirect">history of the Roman Republic</a> during the period of their greatness formed a practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which he studied especially. The history reads well and impartially, and displays conscientious use of sources. The influence of the author's military experience shows itself in certain portions of the narrative. Tired of teaching, he resigned his professorship in 1785, and devoted himself to the revision of his lectures, which he published (1792) under the title of <i><a href="/w/index.php?title=Principles_of_Moral_and_Political_Science&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Principles of Moral and Political Science (page does not exist)">Principles of Moral and Political Science</a></i>.
</p><p>In his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of the history, visited <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and some of the principal cities of Europe, where he was received with honour by <a href="/wiki/Learned_societies" title="Learned societies" class="mw-redirect">learned societies</a>. From 1795 he resided successively at <a href="/wiki/Neidpath_Castle" title="Neidpath Castle">Neidpath Castle</a> near <a href="/wiki/Peebles" title="Peebles">Peebles</a>, at Hallyards on <a href="/wiki/Manor_Water" title="Manor Water">Manor Water</a>, and at <a href="/wiki/St_Andrews" title="St Andrews">St Andrews</a>, where he died on 22 February 1816.  He is buried in the churchyard of <a href="/wiki/St_Andrews_Cathedral" title="St Andrews Cathedral">St Andrews Cathedral</a>, against the north wall, just east of the eastmost fragments of the cathedral. The very large monument includes a carved profile portrait in marble.

<p>In his <a href="/wiki/Ethical_system" title="Ethical system" class="mw-redirect">ethical system</a> Ferguson treats man as a social being, illustrating his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the progression of the <a href="/wiki/Human_race" title="Human race" class="mw-redirect">human race</a>, he placed the principle of moral approbation in the attainment of perfection. <a href="/wiki/Victor_Cousin" title="Victor Cousin">Victor Cousin</a> criticised Ferguson's speculations (see his <i>Cours d'histoire de la philosophie morale an dix-huitième siècle</i>, pt. II., 1839–1840):
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We find in his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of perfection is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above all his predecessors."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By this principle Ferguson attempted to reconcile all moral systems.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

His contemporaries, with the exception of Hume, regarded his writings as of great importance, but he made minimal original contributions (see <a href="/wiki/Sir_Leslie_Stephen" title="Sir Leslie Stephen" class="mw-redirect">Sir Leslie Stephen</a>, <i>English Thought in the Eighteenth Century</i>, x. 89-90).

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Social_thought">Social thought</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="/w/index.php?title=Adam_Ferguson&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Social thought">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p>Ferguson's <i><a href="/wiki/Essay_on_the_History_of_Civil_Society" title="Essay on the History of Civil Society" class="mw-redirect">Essay on the History of Civil Society</a></i> (1767) drew on classical authors and contemporary travel literature, to analyze modern commercial society with a critique of its abandonment of civic and communal virtues. Central themes in Ferguson's theory of citizenship are conflict, play, political participation and military valor. He emphasized the ability to put oneself in another's shoes, saying "fellow-feeling" was so much an "appurtenance of human nature" as to be a "characteristic of the species."  Like his friends <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a> and <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> as well as other Scottish intellectuals, he stressed the importance of the spontaneous order; that is, that coherent and even effective outcomes might result from the uncoordinated actions of many individuals.
</p><p>Ferguson saw history as a two-tiered synthesis of natural history and social history, to which all humans belong. Natural history is created by <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>; so are humans, who are progressive. Social history is, in accordance with this natural progress, made by humans, and because of that factor it experiences occasional setbacks. But in general, humans are empowered by God to pursue progress in social history. Humans live not for themselves but for God's providential plan. He emphasized aspects of medieval <a href="/wiki/Chivalry" title="Chivalry">chivalry</a> as ideal <a href="/wiki/Masculine" title="Masculine" class="mw-redirect">masculine</a> characteristics. British gentleman and young men were advised to dispense with aspects of politeness considered too <a href="/wiki/Feminine" title="Feminine" class="mw-redirect">feminine</a>, such as the constant desire to please, and to adopt less superficial qualities that suggested inner <a href="/wiki/Virtue" title="Virtue">virtue</a> and <a href="/wiki/Courtesy" title="Courtesy">courtesy</a> toward the 'fairer sex.'<sup id="cite_ref-Kettler.2C_1965_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kettler.2C_1965-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Ferguson was a leading advocate of the <a href="/wiki/Idea_of_Progress" title="Idea of Progress">Idea of Progress</a>. He believed that the growth of a commercial society through the pursuit of individual self-interest could promote a self-sustaining progress. Yet paradoxically Ferguson also believed that such commercial growth could foster a decline in virtue and thus ultimately lead to a collapse similar to Rome's. Ferguson, a devout <a href="/wiki/Church_of_Scotland" title="Church of Scotland">Presbyterian</a>, resolved the apparent paradox by placing both developments in the context of a divinely ordained plan that mandated both progress and human free will. For Ferguson, the knowledge that humanity gains through its actions, even those actions resulting in temporary retrogression, form an intrinsic part of its progressive, asymptotic movement toward an ultimately unobtainable perfectibility.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Ferguson was influenced by  classical humanism and such writers as <a href="/wiki/Tacitus" title="Tacitus">Tacitus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli" title="Niccolò Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes" title="Thomas Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>. The fellow members of Edinburgh's Select Society, which included <a href="/wiki/David_Hume" title="David Hume">David Hume</a> and <a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, were also major influences. Ferguson believed that civilization is largely about laws that restrict our independence as individuals but provide liberty in the sense of security and justice. He warned that social chaos usually leads to despotism. The members of civil society give up their liberty-as-autonomy, which savages possess, in exchange for liberty-as-security, or civil liberty. <a href="/wiki/Montesquieu" title="Montesquieu">Montesquieu</a> used a similar argument.<sup id="cite_ref-Kettler.2C_1965_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kettler.2C_1965-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Smith emphasized capital accumulation as the driver of growth, but Ferguson suggested innovation and technical advance were more important, and he is therefore in some ways more in line with modern thinking. According to Smith, commerce tends to make men 'dastardly'. This foreshadows a theme Ferguson, borrowing freely from Smith, took up to criticize capitalism.  Ferguson's critique of commercial society went far beyond that of Smith, and influenced <a href="/wiki/Hegel" title="Hegel" class="mw-redirect">Hegel</a> and Marx.<sup id="cite_ref-Kettler.2C_1965_5-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kettler.2C_1965-5">[5]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i>Essay</i> has been seen as an innovative attempt to reclaim the tradition of republican citizenship in modern Britain, and an influence on the ideas of <a href="/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States" title="Republicanism in the United States">republicanism</a> held by the American <a href="/wiki/Founding_Fathers" title="Founding Fathers" class="mw-redirect">Founding Fathers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Kettler.2C_1965_5-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kettler.2C_1965-5">[5]</a></sup>
