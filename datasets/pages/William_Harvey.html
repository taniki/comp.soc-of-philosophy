<p>The next important phase of Harvey's life began with his appointment to the office of <a href="/wiki/Lumleian_lectures" title="Lumleian lectures" class="mw-redirect">Lumleian lecturer</a> on 4 August 1615. The Lumleian lectureship, founded by <a href="/wiki/John_Lumley,_1st_Baron_Lumley" title="John Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley">Lord Lumley</a> and a Dr. <a href="/wiki/Richard_Caldwell" title="Richard Caldwell">Richard Caldwell</a> in 1582, consisted in pronouncing lectures for a period of seven years, with the purpose of "spreading light" and increasing the general knowledge of <a href="/wiki/Anatomy" title="Anatomy">anatomy</a> throughout England.
</p><p>Harvey began his lectures in April 1616. At this time, at the age of thirty-seven, he was described as "a man of lowest stature, round faced; his eyes small, round, very black and full of spirit; his hair as black as a raven and curling".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup> The notes which he used at the time are preserved in the <a href="/wiki/British_Museum" title="British Museum">British Museum</a>.
</p><p>At the beginning of his lectures, Harvey laid down the canons for his guidance:
</p>
<ol><li>"To show as much as may be at a glance, the whole belly for instance, and afterwards to subdivide the parts according to their positions and relations.</li>
<li>To point out what is peculiar to the actual body which is being dissected.</li>
<li>To supply only by speech what cannot be shown on your own credit and by authority.</li>
<li>To cut up as much as may be in the sight of the audience.</li>
<li>To enforce the right opinion by remarks drawn far and near, and to illustrate man by the structure of animals.</li>
<li>Not to praise or dispraise other anatomists, for all did well, and there was some excuse even for those who are in error.</li>
<li>Not to dispute with others, or attempt to confute them, except by the most obvious retort.</li>
<li>To state things briefly and plainly, yet not letting anything pass unmentioned which can be seen.</li>
<li>Not to speak of anything which can be as well explained without the body or can be read at home.</li>
<li>Not to enter into too much detail, or in too minute dissection, for the time does not permit.</li>
<li>To serve three courses according to the glass [<i>i.e.</i> allot a definite time to each part of the body]. In the first day's lectures the abdomen, nasty yet recompensed by its infinite variety. In the second the parlour, [<i>i.e.</i> the thorax?]. In the third day's lecture the divine banquet of the brain."<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup></li></ol>

<p>Harvey continued to participate in the Lumleian lectures while also taking care of his patients at <a href="/wiki/St_Bartholomew%27s_Hospital" title="St Bartholomew's Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a>; he thus soon attained an important and fairly lucrative practice, which climaxed with his appointment as 'Physician Extraordinary' to <a href="/wiki/James_I_of_England" title="James I of England" class="mw-redirect">King James I</a> on 3 February 1618. He seems to have similarly served various <a href="/wiki/Aristocracy_(class)" title="Aristocracy (class)">aristocrats</a>, including <a href="/wiki/Francis_Bacon" title="Francis Bacon">Lord Chancellor Bacon</a>. 
</p><p>In 1628 he published in <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> his completed treatise on the circulation of the blood, the <i><a href="/wiki/De_Motu_Cordis" title="De Motu Cordis" class="mw-redirect">De Motu Cordis</a></i>. As a result of negative comments by other physicians Harvey "fell mightily in his practice",<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup> but continued advancing his career. He was re-elected 'Censor' of the College of Physicians in 1629, having been elected for the first time in 1613 and the second time in 1625.

<p>Harvey was a prominent sceptic regarding allegations of witchcraft. He was one of the examiners of four women from Lancashire accused of witchcraft in 1634, and as a consequence of his report, all of them were acquitted.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> Earlier, in 1632, while travelling with the King to Newmarket, he had been sent to investigate a woman accused of being a witch. Initially he told her that he was a wizard and had come to discuss the Craft with her, and asked whether she had a familiar. She put down a saucer of milk and called to a toad which came out and drank the milk. He then sent her out to fetch some ale, and killed the toad and dissected it, concluding that it was a perfectly ordinary animal and not supernatural in any way. When the woman returned she was naturally very angry and upset, but Harvey eventually silenced her by stating that he was the King's Physician, sent to discover whether she were a witch, and if she were, to have her apprehended.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup>

<p>At the age of fifty-two, Harvey received commands by the king to accompany the <a href="/wiki/Duke_of_Lennox" title="Duke of Lennox">Duke of Lennox</a> during his trip abroad.

During this journey he wrote to <a href="/wiki/Viscount_Dorchester" title="Viscount Dorchester" class="mw-redirect">Viscount Dorchester</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can complain that by the way we could scarce see a dog, crow, kite, raven or any other bird, or anything to anatomize, only some few miserable people, the relics of the war and the plague where famine had made anatomies before I came. It is scarce credible in so rich, populous, and plentiful countries as these were that so much misery and desolation, poverty and famine should in so short a time be, as we have seen. I interpret it well that it will be a great motive for all here to have and procure assurance of settled <a href="/wiki/Peace" title="Peace">peace</a>.

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having returned to England in 1632, Harvey accompanied King <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a> wherever he went as 'Physician in Ordinary.' In particular, Charles' hunting expeditions gave Harvey access to many deer carcasses; it was upon them that Harvey made many observations and consequent theories. Harvey returned to Italy in 1636, dining at the English College, Rome, as a guest of the Jesuits there, in October 1636. It is possible he met Galileo in Florence en route.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">&#91;15&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/English_Civil_War" title="English Civil War">English Civil War</a> a mob of citizen-soldiers against the King entered Harvey's lodgings, stole his goods, and scattered his papers. The papers consisted of "the records of a large number of dissections... of diseased bodies, with this observations on the development on insects, and a series of notes on comparative anatomy."<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> During this period, Harvey maintained his position, helped the wounded on several occasions and protected the <a href="/wiki/King" title="King" class="mw-redirect">King</a>'s children during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Edgehill" title="Battle of Edgehill">Battle of Edgehill</a>.

"In <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> he (Harvey) very soon settled down to his accustomed pursuits, unmindful of the clatter of arms and of the constant marching and countermarching around him, for the city remained the base of operations until its surrender...

<p>The surrender of Oxford in 1645 marks the beginning of Harvey's gradual retirement from public life and duties. Now sixty-eight years old and childless, Harvey had lost three brothers and his wife by this time. He thus decided to return to London, and lived with his brothers Eliab and Daniel at different periods. Having retired from <a href="/wiki/St_Bartholomew%27s_Hospital" title="St Bartholomew's Hospital">St Bartholomew's Hospital</a> and his various other aforementioned positions, he passed most of this time reading general literature. Several attempts to bring Harvey back into the 'working world' were made, however; here is an excerpt of one of Harvey's answers:

<p>Harvey died at <a href="/wiki/Roehampton" title="Roehampton">Roehampton</a> in the house of his brother Eliab on 3 June 1657. Descriptions of the event seem to show that he died of a cerebral <a href="/wiki/Hemorrhage" title="Hemorrhage" class="mw-redirect">hemorrhage</a> from vessels long injured by <a href="/wiki/Gout" title="Gout">gout</a>: it is highly probable that the left <a href="/wiki/Middle_cerebral_artery" title="Middle cerebral artery">middle cerebral artery</a> malfunctioned, leading to a gradual accumulation of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Human_brain" title="Human brain">brain</a> which eventually overwhelmed it. There exists a fairly detailed account of what happened on that day; according to the information at hand, Harvey:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"went to speak and found that he had the dead palsy in his tongue; then he saw what was to become of him. He knew there were then no hopes of his recovery, so presently he sends for his young nephews to come up to him. He then made signs (for seized with the dead palsy in his tongue he could not speak) to let him blood his tongue, which did him little or no good, and so ended his days, dying in the evening of the day on which he was stricken, the palsy giving him an easy passport."<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup>

<p>His <a href="/wiki/Will_(law)" title="Will (law)" class="mw-redirect">will</a> distributed his material goods and wealth throughout his extended family and also left a substantial amount of money to the <a href="/wiki/College_of_Physicians" title="College of Physicians" class="mw-redirect">College of Physicians</a>.
</p><p>Harvey was buried in <a href="/wiki/Hempstead,_Essex" title="Hempstead, Essex">Hempstead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Essex" title="Essex">Essex</a>. The funeral procession started on 26 June 1657 leading Harvey to be placed in the 'Harvey Chapel' built by Eliab.

<p>Published in 1628 in the city of <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt" title="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a> (host to an <a href="/wiki/Frankfurt_Book_Fair" title="Frankfurt Book Fair">annual book fair</a> that Harvey knew would allow immediate dispersion of his work), 72 page <i><a href="/wiki/Exercitatio_Anatomica_de_Motu_Cordis_et_Sanguinis_in_Animalibus" title="Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus">Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus</a></i> contains the matured account of the <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_circulation" title="Pulmonary circulation">circulation of the blood</a>. Opening with a simple but clear dedication to <a href="/wiki/Charles_I_of_England" title="Charles I of England">King Charles I</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Quarto" title="Quarto">quarto</a> has 17 chapters which give a perfectly clear and connected account of the action of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> and the consequent movement of the <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> around the body in a circuit. Having only a tiny lens at his disposal, Harvey was not able to reach the adequate pictures that were attained through such microscopes used by <a href="/wiki/Leeuwenhoek" title="Leeuwenhoek" class="mw-redirect">Leeuwenhoek</a>; thus he had to resort to theory – and not practical evidence – in certain parts of his book.
After the first chapter, which simply outlines past ideas and accepted rules regarding the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> and <a href="/wiki/Lungs" title="Lungs" class="mw-redirect">lungs</a>, Harvey moves on to a fundamental premise to his treatise, stating that it was extremely important to study the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> when it was active in order to truly comprehend its true movement; a task which even he found of great difficulty, as he says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p> "...I found the task so truly arduous... that I was almost tempted to think... that the movement of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> was only to be comprehended by <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>. For I could neither rightly perceive at first when the <a href="/wiki/Systole_(medicine)" title="Systole (medicine)" class="mw-redirect">systole</a> and when the <a href="/wiki/Diastole" title="Diastole">diastole</a> took place by reason of the rapidity of the movement..."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22">&#91;22&#93;</a></sup>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This initial thought led Harvey's ambition and assiduousness to a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> (studied with less hindrances in cold-blooded animals). After this, Harvey goes on to an analysis of the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a>, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the <a href="/wiki/Left_ventricle" title="Left ventricle" class="mw-redirect">left ventricle</a>, while the contraction of the <a href="/wiki/Right_ventricle" title="Right ventricle" class="mw-redirect">right ventricle</a> propels its charge of blood into the <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_artery" title="Pulmonary artery">pulmonary artery</a>. Whilst doing this, the physician reiterates the fact that these two <a href="/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)" title="Ventricle (heart)">ventricles</a> move together almost simultaneously and not independently as had been thought previously by his predecessors. This discovery was made while observing the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> of such animals as the <a href="/wiki/Eel" title="Eel">eel</a> and several other types of <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>; indeed, the general study of countless animals was of utmost importance to the physician: among the ones already cited, one can add the study of the <a href="/wiki/Snail" title="Snail">snail</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Invisible_shrimp" title="Invisible shrimp" class="mw-redirect">invisible shrimp</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Chicken" title="Chicken">chick</a> before its hatching and even the pigeon. A digression to an experiment can be made to this note: using the inactive <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> of a dead <a href="/wiki/Pigeon" title="Pigeon" class="mw-redirect">pigeon</a> and placing upon it a finger wet with <a href="/wiki/Saliva" title="Saliva">saliva</a>, Harvey was able to witness a transitory and yet incontrovertible pulsation. He had just witnessed the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a>'s ability to recover from <a href="/wiki/Fatigue_(medical)" title="Fatigue (medical)">fatigue</a>.
</p><p>As early as the 17th century, William Harvey had already discerned the existence of the <a href="/wiki/Ductus_arteriosus" title="Ductus arteriosus">Ductus Arteriosus</a> and explained its relative function. Here he says, "...in <a href="/wiki/Embryos" title="Embryos" class="mw-redirect">embryos</a>, whilst the <a href="/wiki/Lungs" title="Lungs" class="mw-redirect">lungs</a> are in a state of inaction, performing no function, subject to no movement any more than if they had not been present, <a href="/wiki/Nature" title="Nature">Nature</a> uses the two <a href="/wiki/Ventricle_(heart)" title="Ventricle (heart)">ventricles</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> as if they formed but one for the transmission of the <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23">&#91;23&#93;</a></sup> However, the apex of Harvey's work is probably the eighth chapter, in which he deals with the actual quantity of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> passing through the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> to the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a>. Coming into conflict with <a href="/wiki/Galen" title="Galen">Galen</a>'s accepted view of the <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> as the origin of <a href="/wiki/Venous" title="Venous" class="mw-redirect">venous</a> <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a>, Harvey estimated the capacity of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a>, how much <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> is expelled through each <a href="/wiki/Pump" title="Pump">pump</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a>, and the number of times the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> beats in a half an hour. All of these estimates were purposefully low, so that people could see the vast amount of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> <a href="/wiki/Galen" title="Galen">Galen</a>'s theory required the <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> to produce. He estimated that the capacity of the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> was 1.5 <a href="/wiki/Imperial_fluid_ounce" title="Imperial fluid ounce" class="mw-redirect">imperial fluid ounces</a> (43&#160;<a href="/wiki/Millilitre" title="Millilitre" class="mw-redirect">ml</a>), and that every time the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> pumps, 1/8 of that <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> is expelled. This led to Harvey's estimate that about <span class="frac nowrap"><sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>6</sub></span> imperial fluid ounce (4.7&#160;ml) of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> went through the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> every time it pumped. The next estimate he used was that the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> beats 1000 times every half an hour, which gave 10 pounds 6 ounces of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> in a half an hour, and when this number was multiplied by 48 half hours in a day he realized that the <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> would have to produce 540 pounds of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> in a day.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">&#91;<i><a href="/wiki/Exercitatio_Anatomica_de_Motu_Cordis_et_Sanguinis_in_Animalibus" title="Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus"><span title="This text contradicts material at the article &#39;Exercitatio Anatomica de Motu Cordis et Sanguinis in Animalibus&#39;. (June 2012)">contradictory</span></a></i>&#93;</sup>
</p><p>Having this simple but essential mathematical proportion at hand – which proved the overall impossible aforementioned role of the <a href="/wiki/Liver" title="Liver">liver</a> – Harvey went on to prove how the <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on <a href="/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">serpents</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fish" title="Fish">fish</a>: tying their <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a> in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> would become empty, while as he did the same to the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a>, the organ would swell up.

This would cut off <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> flow from the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a>. When this was done, the arm below the <a href="/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)" title="Ligature (medicine)">ligature</a> was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen. The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a> to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm and swollen. The <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> were also more visible, since now they were full of <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a>. Harvey then noticed little bumps in the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a>, which he realized were the <a href="/wiki/Valves" title="Valves" class="mw-redirect">valves</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a>, discovered by his teacher, <a href="/wiki/Hieronymus_Fabricius" title="Hieronymus Fabricius">Hieronymus Fabricius</a>. Harvey tried to push <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Vein" title="Vein">vein</a> down the arm, but to no avail. When he tried to push it up the arm, it moved quite easily. The same effect was seen in other <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> of the body, except the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> in the neck. Those <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> were different from the others – they did not allow <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> to flow up, but only down. This led Harvey to believe that the <a href="/wiki/Veins" title="Veins" class="mw-redirect">veins</a> allowed <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> to flow to the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a>, and the <a href="/wiki/Valves" title="Valves" class="mw-redirect">valves</a> maintained the one way flow.
<p>Contrary to a popular misconception, Harvey did not predict the existence of <a href="/wiki/Capillaries" title="Capillaries" class="mw-redirect">capillaries</a>. His observations convinced him that direct connection between veins and arteries are unnecessary; he wrote "blood permeates the pores" in the flesh and it is "absorbed and imbibed from every part" by the veins.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24">&#91;24&#93;</a></sup>

<p>At the time of Harvey's publication, <a href="/wiki/Galen" title="Galen">Galen</a> had been an influential medical authority for several centuries. Galen believed that blood passed between the ventricles by means of invisible pores. According to Galen's views, the venous system was quite separate from the arterial system, except when they came in contact through the unseen pores. Arabic scholar <a href="/wiki/Ibn_al-Nafis" title="Ibn al-Nafis">Ibn al-Nafis</a> had disputed aspects of Galen's views, providing a model that seems to imply a form of <a href="/wiki/Pulmonary_circulation" title="Pulmonary circulation">pulmonary circulation</a> in his Commentary on Anatomy in <a href="/wiki/Avicenna" title="Avicenna">Avicenna</a>'s Canon (1242). Al-Nafis stated that blood moved from the heart to the lungs, where it mixed with air, and then back to the heart, from which it spread to the rest of the body.<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25">&#91;25&#93;</a></sup> Harvey's discoveries inevitably and historically came into conflict with Galen's teachings and the publication of his treatise <a href="/wiki/De_Motu_Cordis" title="De Motu Cordis" class="mw-redirect">De Motu Cordis</a> incited considerable controversy within the medical community. Some doctors affirmed they would "rather err with Galen than proclaim the truth with Harvey."<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26">&#91;26&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27">&#91;27&#93;</a></sup> Galen incompletely perceived the function of the heart, believing it a "productor of heat", while the function of its affluents, the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a>, was that of cooling the <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a> as the <a href="/wiki/Lungs" title="Lungs" class="mw-redirect">lungs</a> "...fanned and cooled the <a href="/wiki/Heart" title="Heart">heart</a> itself".<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28">&#91;28&#93;</a></sup> Galen thought that during <a href="/wiki/Vasodilation" title="Vasodilation">dilation</a> the <a href="/wiki/Arteries" title="Arteries" class="mw-redirect">arteries</a> sucked in air, while during their contraction they discharged vapours through pores in the flesh and skin.
</p><p>Until the 17th century, two separate systems were thought to be involved in blood circulation: the <i>natural</i> system, containing <a href="/wiki/Venous_blood" title="Venous blood">venous blood</a> which had its origin in the liver, and the <i>vital</i> system, containing <a href="/wiki/Arterial_blood" title="Arterial blood">arterial blood</a> and the 'spirits' which flowed from the heart, distributing heat and life to all parts. Like bellows, the lungs fanned and cooled this vital blood.
</p><p>Independently of Ibn Al-Nafis, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Servetus" title="Michael Servetus">Michael Servetus</a> identified pulmonary circulation, but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the Manuscript of Paris in 1546.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-29">&#91;29&#93;</a></sup> It was later published in the theological work which caused his execution in 1553, almost all copies of which were destroyed. In: <i>Christianismi Restitutio</i>, Book V, the Aragonese Miguel Servet (Michel de Villeneuve, 1509?–1553) wrote: 'The blood is passed through the pulmonary artery to the pulmonary vein for a lengthy pass through the lungs, during which it becomes red, and gets rid of the sooty fumes by the act of exhalation'.
</p><p>Pulmonary circulation was described by <a href="/wiki/Renaldus_Columbus" title="Renaldus Columbus" class="mw-redirect">Renaldus Columbus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Andrea_Cesalpino" title="Andrea Cesalpino">Andrea Cesalpino</a> and <a href="/wiki/Vesalius" title="Vesalius" class="mw-redirect">Vesalius</a>, before Harvey would provide a refined and complete description of the circulatory system.

<p>In terms of his personality, information shows that William Harvey was seen as a "...humorous but extremely precise man...",<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33">&#91;33&#93;</a></sup> how he was often so immersed in his own thoughts that he would often suffer from <a href="/wiki/Insomnia" title="Insomnia">insomnia</a> (cured with a simple walk through the house), and how he was always ready for an open and direct conversation. He also loved the darkness, for it is said that it was there where "...he could best contemplate", thus sometimes hiding out in caves. A heavy drinker of coffee, Harvey would walk out combing his hair every morning full of energy and enthusiastic spirit through the fields. We have also come to understand Harvey's somewhat unorthodox method of dealing with his <a href="/wiki/Gout" title="Gout">gout</a>, here cited completely: "...his [Harvey's] cure was thus: he would sit with his legs bare...put them into a pail of water till he was almost dead with cold, then betake himself to his stove, and so 'twas gone".<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34">&#91;34&#93;</a></sup> Apart from the already mentioned love of literature, Harvey was also an intense and dedicated observer of birds during his free time: several long and detailed passages of citations could be written delineating his observations in such places as the "<a href="/w/index.php?title=Pile_of_Boulders&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Pile of Boulders (page does not exist)">Pile of Boulders</a>" (a small <a href="/wiki/Island" title="Island">island</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>) and '<a href="/wiki/Bass_Rock" title="Bass Rock">Bass Rock</a>' (island off the East Coast of <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>).
